In this activity, you will learn how to label the parts of the argument by adding the letters (p) and (c) in front of the premise(s) and conclusion(s). For example:

!!! “All humans are mortal, and Lucy is a human. So, Lucy is mortal.”

Unlike the examples of arguments in the topics 1 and 2, notice that this argument is not written vertically but horizontally. Most arguments written in ordinary discourse (e.g. the news, Facebook, etc.) will be expressed horizontally. That horizontal format already makes the argument more difficult to locate. The first sentence includes two statements and both statements are different premises of the argument. The conclusion is the second sentence indicated by the keyword “So.” The objective is to label the premises and conclusion with symbols so that the reader can identify the argument more accurately. In doing so, begin by first labeling the premises and conclusion by writing the letter “p” in parentheses at the beginning of the premises, and the letter “c” in parentheses next to the conclusion. For example:

!!! **(P)** All humans are mortal, and **(P)** Lucy is a human. **(C)** So, Lucy is mortal.

In that example, “P” stands for premise and (C) means conclusion. **Note again: the order of the premises does not matter in this Unit. One can reverse the order of the premises and produce the same argument**. When reading more complex arguments, labeling the premises and conclusion becomes essential to be sure one correctly identifies the argument.

### Label the Premises and Conclusions
:fa-pencil: Identify which of the following are premises and which are conclusions. Label by filling the blanks using the appropriate letters.

_Checklist:_

- Focus on statements and ignore non-statements
- Locate the premises and conclusion using keywords
- Label the premises and conclusion by inserting the appropriate letter in the blank in front of the statements: P for premise, and C for Conclusion. Be sure to ignore non-statements by inserting an "X" in the blank in front of the non-statement.

**Example:**

Argument:
!!! “All conservatives are Christian. Charlie is conservative. Therefore, Charlie is Christian.”

Solution:
!!! (P) All conservatives are Christian. (P) Charlie is conservative. (C) Therefore, Charlie is Christian.
