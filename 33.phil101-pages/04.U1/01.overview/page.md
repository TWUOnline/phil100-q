## Overview
This unit focuses on wisdom. In this unit, we will (i) introduce some concepts of wisdom found in the literature; and (ii) introduce the "Life Skills" to journal and practice.

This unit is divided into the following topics:
1. Wisdom and Action
2. Wisdom and Knowledge
3. Wisdom and Humility
4. Wisdom and Bias
6. Wisdom and Charity
