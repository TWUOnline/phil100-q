This quiz requires you to read the excerpts carefully and identify the premises and main conclusion of the argument.
Sub-conclusions may serve as premises in some arguments. Consequently, some indicator words for conclusions, such as "therefore" and "hence", may indicate a sub-conclusion rather than the main conclusion. Make sure these sub-conclusions are identified as premises, not conclusions.

Remember to read the entire passage a couple of times before attempting to identify the premises and the conclusion. The reason is so that you can better understand and interpret what the author intended to say.
