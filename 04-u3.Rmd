# Reason

This final unit is about arguments. This unit is valuable because everything we’ve discussed so far, both about wisdom and faith, is built upon the foundation of arguments. We give arguments for our views about wisdom. We give arguments about issues of faith and rationality. This last unit provides the opportunity for you to learn a basic skill of how to identify an argument, whether the argument is located in a book, and more often on YouTube, a podcast, and in the news. Note that we do not cover how to evaluate arguments in this unit. Evaluating arguments is a skill taught in other Philosophy courses.

In topic 1, we learn about the parts of the argument, such as the proper terms used to designate these different parts. If we wish to learn how to identify arguments, we must know what terms to look for. In topic 2, we learn about how to label and structure arguments. Often people do not organize their argument clearly and so we must learn how to reconstruct the argument so that we know the conclusion and the reasons for supporting the conclusion. In topic 3, we tackle slightly more complicated arguments and learn how to interpret what the author intended to say. As practiced in topic 2, people often organize their arguments (or, occasionally, non-arguments) in a confusing way. Moreover, we will learn about tricky terms often used in arguments, such as the terms “if” and “then”. In the final topic, we practice identifying difficult arguments, which often include long texts, run on sentences, and additional irrelevant content to the argument being put forward. Our task in the final topic is to use our skills practiced in topics 1-3 to identify more difficult arguments.

### Topic Notes {-}

In this topic, we learn about the parts of the argument and the words often used to designate these parts. Arguments are made up of statements. Statements are claims that are either true or false. Sometimes statements are whole sentences, while other times statements are phrases. For example, the question, “Is there a God?” is not a statement because the question does not state something that is either true or false. The answer to this question, “yes there is a God,” or “no, there is no God” are statements because they express claims that are either true or false. Other parts of the argument are the premises and conclusion. The premises are the statements that support the conclusion. The conclusion is the statement that is being argued for by the premises. The inference is the move from the premises to the conclusion. Imagine someone says they believe that God exists. This is their conclusion. You ask them, “why think that God exists?” Their response is going to be a reason (i.e. a premise) or a set of reasons (i.e. a set of premises) that are supposed to support their conclusion. The inference is the nature of the support from premise to conclusion.

Some of the primary keywords of an argument are terms that describe premises and conclusions. For example, the word “therefore” often picks out a conclusion. The statement that follows from the term “therefore” may act as a conclusion. Terms that describe premise can be “all” “every” “some”. As we shall see, these types of words help us identify the premises of an argument.

### Topic Notes {-}

In the previous topic, we learned about the parts and keywords of an argument. In this topic, we learn how to label these parts of the argument and then restructure the argument vertically, with premises and conclusion, so that we may see the argument clearly. The steps for applying these tools follow this pattern: (i) focus on statements and ignore non-statements. Recall from the previous topic that arguments are made up of statements only and never non-statements. Thus, only focus on statements and cross out any non-statements. (ii) Locate the premises and conclusion amongst the set of statements using keywords. As discussed, premises and conclusions often have terms that designate them, such as “therefore”.

Once the argument has been labelled, the next step is to restructure the argument vertically with the premises on top and the conclusion beneath. This way we can see what the author’s argument is exactly. That is, we can see the conclusion – the main point of their position – and the reasons (i.e. premises) for thinking the conclusion is true. Once these statements are ordered correctly, anyone can see the argument. The reader needn’t labour over the text and the many confusing non-statements to locate the point of the passage.

### Topic Notes {-}

In the first two topics, we learned some foundational skills for identifying arguments, such as the parts and keywords of an argument, and the methods for labeling and restructuring arguments. The challenge, however, is that ordinary discourse – both written and verbal – often makes the argument difficult to identify. We often must interpret what we think the author intended to say about their view and then structure the argument according to this intention. In this topic, we practice the skill of interpretating arguments. One strategy for interpreting an argument is the “Why/Because” strategy. If it’s difficult to identify the premises and conclusion, then look for statements that may follow with a hypothetical “why”. Such statements may be the conclusion(s). The reason is that concluding statements have by definition reasons for them. And the term “why” may pick out these reasons. The term “because” often precedes a reason (i.e. a premise) and so looking for statements that may be preceded with “because” may help with identifying the premises.

A second skill of interpretation is learning to navigate conditional statements. A conditional is a “if … then” statement. For example, “If it’s raining outside, then we can’t go to the park.” Sentences with the words “if” and “then” may be interpreted in different ways depending on the order of these words. In this topic we practice some of these interpretive skills.

### Topic Notes {-}

In the previous topics, we have attempted to build our foundation for identifying arguments. The real challenge is when we’re confronted with long speeches, texts, reports, stories, and accusations whereby the argument may often seem unclear. Our task is to use the tools we’ve learned to identify the argument(s) in more difficult contexts. In this topic, we practice these skills by following these steps: (i) ignore non-statements and label the premises and conclusion; (ii) restructure the argument vertically with premises on top and the conclusion beneath. Notice that the difficult step is (i). We must sift through the content to locate keywords, interpret ambiguous statements, possibly use the “Why/Because” strategy in cases of doubt, decipher unusual “if/then” statements, and so on. Sometimes there is no argument at all; other times there may exist more than one argument, such that there is a main argument, and a secondary argument. The point of this entire exercise is to learn the skill that so many of us fail to properly master: to learn what the opposing person is trying to say. What is their position? What is their argument if there is one? Only after we’ve successfully identified the argument can we then properly raise objections and evaluate their argument.
