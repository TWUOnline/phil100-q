Record a video of yourself answering the questions below. READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY:
1. Be sure your name and class section is in the title when you submit through Moodle.
2. Pick only TWO questions from each category. **DO NOT answer every question**.
3. You must include personal life experiences for each question and connect those experiences to the question. For example, if one were to include question (1) from “General”, they would discuss their preferred topic of wisdom and then reflect on a life experience that best illuminates that topic of wisdom.
4. Be precise. **Your video time cannot exceed 8:00 minutes**. That means you have ~40 seconds per question.  
5. **Preparation is crucial for success**. Be sure to articulate your view clearly and carefully (HINT: write a script to follow. Practice and polish your presentation before recording/submitting to be sure you do not exceed the time limit. Take this opportunity to practice your presentation skills - a skill necessary for many areas of life).

If required, see the instructions below about how to create a video with Microsoft Teams and submit on Moodle.

### General Questions
1.       Which topic of wisdom best resonates with your life experiences? Why?
2.       In your view, how does wisdom contribute to pursuing a good life?
3.       What topic of wisdom do you find the most difficult to apply to your life? Why?
4.       Think of a person in your life (or just in general) whom you believe is wise. What characteristics make that person wise? What habits do they practice?


### Topic 1 Questions
1.       What is one of your goals for this semester?
2.       What are the good habits that must be formed for you to achieve that goal?
3.       What are the bad habits that must be avoided for you to achieve that goal?
4.       What is your strategy if you fail to achieve your goal?


### Topic 2 Questions
1.       Do you believe that knowledge is sufficient for wisdom? Why or why not?
2.       Pick a belief that you strongly affirm. Now try doubting that belief. Force yourself to imagine that the belief is false. Seek out information that reinforces the falsity of the belief. How does that experience make you feel?
3.       How often do you seek valuable knowledge, such as knowledge about God, science, and morality? What activities interfere with your search for valuable knowledge?
4.       Can you think of a good habit that may help you better seek valuable knowledge over entertainment? What is that good habit and how can you implement it in your life?

### Topic 3 Questions
1.       Do you believe intellectual humility is difficult to practice? Why or why not? Describe one example in your life in which you either succeeded or failed at the practice of intellectual humility.
2.       Do you feel uncomfortable with the fact that some of your beliefs are false? Why or why not?
3.       Under what circumstances do you find humility difficult to practice? (For example, perhaps humility is more difficult to employ when your self-image becomes tarnished or when you’re perceived by others as less intelligent).
4.       Can you think of anyone in your life whom you consider intellectually humble? What characteristics does that person possess?

### Topic 4 Questions
2.       Think about a controversial topic in which you hold strong beliefs (e.g. abortion, climate change, sexuality, gender, trans athletes, Black Lives Matter, inflation, religion, atheism, conservativism, liberalism, billionaires, etc.). Is it possible that your beliefs about that topic were formed not by you, but by other forces entirely (e.g. your parents and grandparents, culture and sub-culture, social and peer pressure, financial gain, your ego, and self-image)? In other words, is it possible that you are not as free-thinking as you may perceive, but rather are a human being bullied into believing certain things with little power to escape those biases? Why or why not?
3.       What type of strategy can you employ to help overcome some of your biases?
4.       Think about a controversial topic in which you hold strong beliefs. Now try defending the opposing view. Seek out information that best supports this opposing view. How does the experience make you feel?   
5.       Do you think that recognizing and admitting “myside” biases could help correct the polarization in contemporary culture? (i.e. mainly political polarizations between those on the political left and right)? Why or why not?

### Topic 5 Questions
1.       What is the relationship between charity and some of the other topics of wisdom discussed in this unit?
2.       Think about a controversial topic in which you hold strong beliefs. Do you find it difficult to be charitable to opposing views? Why or why not?
3.       Imagine you’re in a heated discussion with a friend or family member. Now imagine that you try to articulate and defend their view better than them before raising objections. If you’ve experienced that, what happened? If you haven’t experienced that, do you believe that process would help with searching out the truth? Why or why not?
4.       Can you think of anyone in your life whom you consider intellectually charitable? What characteristics does that person possess?
5.       Do you agree or disagree with some of Johnson’s conclusions about the problems with intellectual charity? Why or why not?

### Topic 6 Questions
1.       How does the topic of rhetoric (the art of persuasion) coincide with some of the other topics of wisdom? Does rhetoric conflict with some of those topics?
2.       Do you think that rhetoric is manipulative? Why or why not?
3.       Do you think that rhetoric is about seeking the truth? Why or why not?
4.       Imagine you’re in a heated discussion with a friend or family member. Now imagine that you concede defeat for the purpose of preserving the relationship. If you’ve experienced that, what happened? If you haven’t experienced that, do you believe that process would help preserve the relationship or does that strategy come across as patronizing? Why or why not?
5.       How can the practice of rhetoric help you perform well in a job interview?
