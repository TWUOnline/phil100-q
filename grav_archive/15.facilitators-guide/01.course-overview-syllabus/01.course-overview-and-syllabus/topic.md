# Facilitator’s Guide for Phil 100:  

## Philosophy for Life

Your task as the facilitator is to guide the students through the course content and grade their assignments according to grading rubrics. The course has been designed with detailed instructions and explanations so that the facilitator does not require specialization in philosophy. However, the facilitator should read all the material from the course pack, the instructions in Moodle for each Unit and Topic, and work through the optional material, such as the videos and simulation and logic exercises. The aim of Philosophy 100 is to better equip students to live life well. That aim is achieved in part by helping students work through the three units in the course, wisdom, reason, and faith.

### First class preparation: Introduction to the course

**First preamble:** give reasons for why the course is valuable to students. Why should they care about Phil 100 beyond just the requirement? The purpose of the course is to equip students with skills to live a better life – skills that may enhance their ability to make choices about relationships, professions, and navigating the many cultural, religious, and political issues one faces. Thus, the course is not designed in a traditional sense – i.e. evaluation through memorization, quizzes, exams, and extensive research essays. The course is meant to bridge the divide between philosophy and practical living; the course is meant to reflect the liberal arts tradition of rounding out a person to live a better life and effectively serve their community.

**Course Details:** discuss the format of the entire course, providing a general snapshot for students. Discuss how the assignments work and how they are submitted and graded. Students should not be confused over the grading expectations. After the first preamble, course details is a second priority.

**Resources for classroom content:** Each topic includes additional resources for both students and instructors, including reading highlights, videos, and simulation exercises that can be used both in and outside the classroom.
