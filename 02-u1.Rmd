Wisdom and Action
This topic examines wisdom and action. According to Nozick, wisdom is practical in that wisdom is required to live life well, to cope with and respond to the many challenges of life, and, if possible, avoid some of those challenges. For living life well, wisdom requires both affirming the right beliefs and practicing the right actions. How do we know which beliefs and actions are appropriate for living life well? Nozick argues that a wise person holds beliefs about many aspects of life, including beliefs about life's most important values, beliefs about achieving one's goals, and following the necessary steps to achieve these goals. Likewise, the right actions for living a fulfilling life are derived from applying the aforementioned beliefs. If a person knows about the most important values and goals in life, but never applies them to their behavior, then they are not considered wise. In other words, having knowledge does not entail wisdom. Nozick is also aware that applying the appropriate beliefs and actions is not sufficient to live life well. Sometimes bad things occur for no apparent reason, which may undermine our efforts. A wise person is aware of this problem, and while pursuing their goals, prepares for failure, learns how to avoid it, and how to respond to it if failure occurs. In the following video, we briefly discuss some of Nozick’s ideas about wisdom and action.

## 1.2 Wisdom and Knowledge {-}

This topic examines wisdom and knowledge. In the previous topic, we established that knowledge is not sufficient for wisdom because wisdom requires action. There are two ideas associated with wisdom and knowledge to discuss. The first idea is that acquiring knowledge requires the practice of doubting. Do not believe everything you read and hear. The second idea is that a wise person obtains knowledge of the most valuable things in life, such as knowledge about God, science, and morality. According to Rene Descartes, pursuing knowledge of these higher domains is not only good in itself, but higher knowledge can enable one to live a better life.

Having doubt about something does not entail rejecting its truth. For our purposes, doubting something means applying careful consideration, such as asking yourself: Why should I think this is true? What is the best way to verify the claim? Who can give me an informed opinion? Healthy doubt is valuable for acquiring knowledge and living life well. For example, whenever we detect incoming scams, such as phone and computer scams, we employ doubt. The hesitation (or doubt) to believe and act according to the computer scam resembles the hesitation one should apply when listening to the news, a podcast, a sermon, or reading an opinion on social media. However, particularly in ordinary affairs, Descartes also warns that extreme doubt may be harmful. Neither the need for basic necessities nor the importance of friendship should be questioned. When individuals are faced with situations such as these, it is often necessary that they act even if they lack all the information about the situation. Descartes argues that remaining paralyzed by doubt is an inadvisable course.

Descartes also believes that one should pursue a higher knowledge about God, science, and morality. His point about seeking this type of valuable knowledge relevant because of the human obsession with entertainment. We often seek entertainment and pleasure rather than searching for the truth about the most important ideas in life. For Descartes, that obsession with entertainment and the neglect of seeking valuable knowledge undermines one’s potential to gain wisdom and seek a fulfilling life. In the following video, we briefly discuss these two ideas, the importance of learning to doubt and the value of seeking higher knowledge about God, science, and morality.
