While we will learn some basic ideas about the nature of wisdom in the first topic on knowledge, most of this unit is devoted to introducing some of the skills of living a life of wisdom and how we can begin to practice these skills. Wisdom Unit 1 Introduction Video (6 min 10 sec) Overview Topics This unit is divided into the following four topics: Wisdom and Knowledge Wisdom and Humility Wisdom and Friendship Wisdom and Rhetoric Learning Outcomes When you’ve completed this unit, you will have learned how to: Identify and understand the role wisdom plays in knowledge, humiloity, friendship and rhetoric Practice and apply the skills of wisdom to knowledge, humility, friendship and rhetoric Apply these skills to the types of actions a wise person may take Enhance your skills of wisdom and reason to live life within the context of justice and faith Develop the skills to become a well-rounded person and citizen and live a wise and just life 1.1 Wisdom and Knowledge Follow and complete the steps below to accomplish your learning for this topic. Read topic notes Watch the Wisdom and Knowledge topic video Read Nozick Complete and download the Required Nozick Reading Note-taking Exercise Complete and download the Required Note-taking Questionnaire Watch the Definition of Wisdom optional video In this topic, we learn about the nature of wisdom and its relationship with knowledge. Wisdom is not just about knowledge. Wisdom is practical in that wisdom is required to live life well, to cope with and respond to the many challenges of life, and, if possible, avoid some of those challenges. While wisdom is practical, it does require at least some knowledge. For living life well, wisdom requires knowing the right beliefs and knowing how to apply these beliefs in the right way at the right time. How do we know which beliefs and actions are appropriate for living life well? Philosopher Robert Nozick argues that a wise person holds beliefs about many aspects of life, including beliefs about life’s most important values, beliefs about achieving one’s goals, and following the necessary steps to achieve these goals. Likewise, the right actions for living a fulfilling life are derived from applying the aforementioned beliefs. If a person knows about the most important values and goals in life, but never applies them to their behavior, then they are not considered wise. In other words, having knowledge does not entail wisdom. Nozick is also aware that applying the appropriate beliefs and actions is not sufficient to live life well. Sometimes bad things occur for no apparent reason, which may undermine our efforts. A wise person is aware of this problem, and while pursuing their goals, prepares for failure, learns how to avoid it, and how to respond to it if failure occurs.

A wise person understands their limitations about what they know and do not know. In other words, a wise person is aware of their ignorance. The word “ignorance” in this case does not have a negative connotation, but rather describes a lack of knowledge about a particular thing. In “the Apology,” Plato introduces the character Socrates, who is on trial for his life. During his defense, Socrates describes the account of his friend, Chaerephon, seeking answers from the Oracle of Delphi, wondering if there is any person wiser than Socrates. In reply to Chaerephon, the oracle says that no one is wiser than Socrates. Socrates is puzzled by the revelation about his wisdom since he considers himself to be unwise. Socrates then asks questions of different people in the city, such as politicians, poets, and artisans, in an attempt to solve the mystery about the oracle’s revelation. Socrates discovers that while these individuals claim to know a great deal about issues such as the nature of beauty and what is good, he observes that they know very little about such issues. These people think they possess knowledge, when in fact they do not, and that is why they lack wisdom. Their way of thinking contrasts with Socrates, who thinks he lacks knowledge about these issues; more specifically, Socrates is aware of his ignorance about the nature of beauty and what is good, while the others are unaware of their own ignorance about these same issues. Because of this, Socrates is the wisest person. One application of being aware of ignorance for seeking wisdom is to practice a humble attitude towards the complex issues in life, such as how to interpret the Bible, evolution, the nature of sexuality, the implications of social media for our lives, and was Donald Trump an effective president? These types of questions represent complex ideas that even some of the most specialized scholars cannot answer. A wise person demonstrates their humility towards these complex issues by asking thoughtful questions about the opposing view, knowing when to withhold judgment and opinion, and with a willingness to change their mind.

Read topic notes Watch the Wisdom and Friendship topic video Read Aristole Complete and download the Required Aristotle Reading Note-taking Exercise Complete and download the Required Note-taking Questionnaire Watch the Aristotle’s Timeless Advice on What Real Friendship Is and Why It Matters optional video This topic examines wisdom and friendship. A wise person is careful about how they view their friends. In doing so, it is best to learn about the various types of friendships. According to Aristotle, there are three types of friendships, friends of utility, pleasure, and virtue. Friends of utility are friends who are a means to an end, such as business partners, or some friends on a sports team. Friends of pleasure are friends with whom we share pleasurable activities. Friends of virtue are friends who exhibit good qualities and help us develop these qualities as well. Aristotle believes that the third type of friend is the best type of friend, and this type of friendship, while difficult to find and develop, is worth pursuing and fighting for. This is because friends of virtue care about us and our character development beyond the scope of utility and pleasure. They care about us even when things are difficult. But how do we find these friends and how can we be virtuous friends to other people? Thomas Aquinas provides some advice. Aquinas suggests that we should be careful about the bad qualities that make for a poor friend, such as envy and pride. These vices (or bad characteristics) undermine the pursuit of virtue and thus compromise any friendship that is built upon virtue. An envious person is someone who is upset about our own success. Think of a friend you have. Have they ever been upset or sad when good things happen to you? If the answer is yes, then this person may not be a virtuous friend. They may suffer from envy towards you. Or have you ever had a friend who jokes about you but can never receive the joke in return? This person may not be a virtuous friend because they suffer from arrogant pride. They think too highly of themselves. Furthermore, we should be cautious about whether we are exhibiting these defects as well. Do we treat our friends as a means to a utilitarian end? Do we make friends only for pleasure? Do we feel upset about our friends success? Do we exhibit a sense of arrogant pride about ourselves? This video introduces these ideas from Aristotle and Aquinas to help better equip us with the skills for developing healthy friendship for living well.

Arguments with other people, such as family, friends, or colleagues, are part of everyday life. A wise person knows how to argue without fighting. According to Jay Heinrichs, a necessary skill for arguing productively is knowing the appropriate goal you wish to bring about. Are you trying to influence someone’s decision? Is that feasible? Are you hoping to feel like a winner? Is that an appropriate goal? It may be your goal to change the mood of your opponent, or simply to inform your opponent of a different point of view. Would you like to end the argument quickly? After the argument, would you like to maintain the relationship with the person? Should you pursue either of these goals? How will you go about accomplishing your goal? In what way are you prepared to compromise? Are you prepared to experience defeat from your opponent’s point of view in order to achieve your goal?

Read topic notes Watch the Faith and Definitions topic video Read Jackson Complete and download the Required Jackson Reading Note-taking Exercise Complete and download the Required Note-taking Questionnaire Watch the Belief vs Faith (Philosophical Distinction) optional video In this topic, we learn about several definitions of the term faith. One distinction to make about faith is between faith as an attitude and faith as an action. Faith as an attitude means that faith is something in our heads. Faith is a mental and cognitive experience, such as a belief, trust, and hope. These ideas are a common way to think about faith. On the other hand, faith as an action refers to an ancient way of thinking about the term. The Greek word for faith is “pistis” and this can refer ethical behavior towards a person or ideal. With regard to faith as an attitude, we will learn about the difference between doxastic faith and non-doxastic faith. The term “doxastic” refers to beliefs. Thus, doxastic faith is faith focusing on belief. Non-doxastic faith focuses on faith that does not include belief. Watch and Reflect In this video, you will learn about the various definitions of faith from Elizabeth Jackson’s article, “Faith: Contemporary Perspectives”.

The first two ways of thinking about faith as an attitude are belief and trust. These attitudes of faith are called doxastic because they generally focus on beliefs – mental and cognitive experiences in our heads. In this topic, we focus on a non-doxastic attitude of faith called hope. Hope is non-doxastic because hope does not necessarily include belief when considering faith. Pojman is going to argue that faith as hope is the more appropriate way to think about faith, especially Christian faith and the doctrine of salvation. Salvation is the idea that the human race is in danger and God is attempting to save them. According to some traditions, if humans believe in God, then God will save them. But for Pojman, humans can’t control what they believe, including their doubts about God. So how can salvation be about something one cannot control? Rather, faith as hope in God and his saving plan seems to be the more accurate way to think about faith and salvation. Watch and Reflect In this video, you will learn about faith as hope in the midst of doubt from Louis Pojman’s article, “Faith, Hope, Doubt”. According to Pojman, faith is a matter of hope and not belief. Thus, faith is non-doxastic.

These conceptions of faith exist in one’s head – as a mental and cognitive experience. Faith as action focuses more on the behavior of a person and not as much on the mental experience. While it’s true that our beliefs and desires and hopes may be causally relevant for our actions, this needn’t always be the case. Thus, faith as action focuses more on ethical behavior as the mode of faith. In this topic, we briefly examine a controversy within Christian theology about the definition of faith. Traditionally, the view of faith was attitudinal, such as belief and trust. More recently, the suggestion is that Christian faith is about Christian ethics and good works and less so about having the attitudinal beliefs and trust about Christianity. Watch and Reflect In this video, you will learn about faith and action from Boyd and Thorsen’s chapter, “Ethics in the Christian Scriptures.” Unlike faith as belief, trust, and hope, faith as action focuses on behavior and ethics, rather than on mental content.

A primary distinction is between faith as attitudes and faith as actions. While these categories may be interwoven, they can also remain distinct. Regardless, the critic of faith will challenge any of these ideas about faith by questioning the rationality of faith, either faith as belief and trust, or faith as action. In this topic, we explore this challenge. The term rationality in this case refers to beliefs and actions aligning with evidence. If beliefs and actions do not align with the evidence, then, according to the evidentialist, such beliefs and actions are irrational. So, according to the objection, for us to exhibit rationality, we must align our beliefs and actions according to the proper evidence. Is this a good objection to the rationality of faith as belief and action? We explore this issue by first reading William Clifford’s famous piece on the ethics of belief. According to Clifford, it is wrong to believe anything not proportional to the evidence. We then consider some response to this evidential objection by noting (i) the possible incoherence of the objection; (ii) the fact that may of our rational beliefs are not proportional to the evidence; (iii) that in some cases of faith, there exists sufficient evidence to meet the rational standard. Watch and Reflect IIn this video, you will learn about faith and rationality from W.K.

This unit is valuable because everything we’ve discussed so far, both about wisdom and faith, is built upon the foundation of arguments. We give arguments for our views about wisdom. We give arguments about issues of faith and rationality. This last unit provides the opportunity for you to learn a basic skill of how to identify an argument, whether the argument is located in a book, and more often on YouTube, a podcast, and in the news. Note that we do not cover how to evaluate arguments in this unit. Evaluating arguments is a skill taught in other Philosophy courses. In topic 1, we learn about the parts of the argument, such as the proper terms used to designate these different parts. If we wish to learn how to identify arguments, we must know what terms to look for. In topic 2, we learn about how to label and structure arguments. Often people do not organize their argument clearly and so we must learn how to reconstruct the argument so that we know the conclusion and the reasons for supporting the conclusion. In topic 3, we tackle slightly more complicated arguments and learn how to interpret what the author intended to say. As practiced in topic 2, people often organize their arguments (or, occasionally, non-arguments) in a confusing way. Moreover, we will learn about tricky terms often used in arguments, such as the terms “if” and “then”. In the final topic, we practice identifying difficult arguments, which often include long texts, run on sentences, and additional irrelevant content to the argument being put forward. Our task in the final topic is to use our skills practiced in topics 1-3 to identify more difficult arguments.

Arguments are made up of statements. Statements are claims that are either true or false. Sometimes statements are whole sentences, while other times statements are phrases. For example, the question, “Is there a God?” is not a statement because the question does not state something that is either true or false. The answer to this question, “yes there is a God,” or “no, there is no God” are statements because they express claims that are either true or false. Other parts of the argument are the premises and conclusion. The premises are the statements that support the conclusion. The conclusion is the statement that is being argued for by the premises. The inference is the move from the premises to the conclusion. Imagine someone says they believe that God exists. This is their conclusion. You ask them, “why think that God exists?” Their response is going to be a reason (i.e. a premise) or a set of reasons (i.e. a set of premises) that are supposed to support their conclusion. The inference is the nature of the support from premise to conclusion. Some of the primary keywords of an argument are terms that describe premises and conclusions. For example, the word “therefore” often picks out a conclusion. The statement that follows from the term “therefore” may act as a conclusion. Terms that describe premise can be “all” “every” “some”. As we shall see, these types of words help us identify the premises of an argument.

In this topic, we learn how to label these parts of the argument and then restructure the argument vertically, with premises and conclusion, so that we may see the argument clearly. The steps for applying these tools follow this pattern: (i) focus on statements and ignore non-statements. Recall from the previous topic that arguments are made up of statements only and never non-statements. Thus, only focus on statements and cross out any non-statements. (ii) Locate the premises and conclusion amongst the set of statements using keywords. As discussed, premises and conclusions often have terms that designate them, such as “therefore”. Once the argument has been labelled, the next step is to restructure the argument vertically with the premises on top and the conclusion beneath. This way we can see what the author’s argument is exactly. That is, we can see the conclusion – the main point of their position – and the reasons (i.e. premises) for thinking the conclusion is true. Once these statements are ordered correctly, anyone can see the argument. The reader needn’t labour over the text and the many confusing non-statements to locate the point of the passage.

Identifying Arguments optional video In the first two topics, we learned some foundational skills for identifying arguments, such as the parts and keywords of an argument, and the methods for labeling and restructuring arguments. The challenge, however, is that ordinary discourse – both written and verbal – often makes the argument difficult to identify. We often must interpret what we think the author intended to say about their view and then structure the argument according to this intention. In this topic, we practice the skill of interpretating arguments. One strategy for interpreting an argument is the “Why/Because” strategy. If it’s difficult to identify the premises and conclusion, then look for statements that may follow with a hypothetical “why”. Such statements may be the conclusion(s). The reason is that concluding statements have by definition reasons for them. And the term “why” may pick out these reasons. The term “because” often precedes a reason (i.e. a premise) and so looking for statements that may be preceded with “because” may help with identifying the premises. A second skill of interpretation is learning to navigate conditional statements. A conditional is a “if … then” statement. For example, “If it’s raining outside, then we can’t go to the park.” Sentences with the words “if” and “then” may be interpreted in different ways depending on the order of these words. In this topic we practice some of these interpretive skills.

The real challenge is when we’re confronted with long speeches, texts, reports, stories, and accusations whereby the argument may often seem unclear. Our task is to use the tools we’ve learned to identify the argument(s) in more difficult contexts. In this topic, we practice these skills by following these steps: (i) ignore non-statements and label the premises and conclusion; (ii) restructure the argument vertically with premises on top and the conclusion beneath. Notice that the difficult step is (i). We must sift through the content to locate keywords, interpret ambiguous statements, possibly use the “Why/Because” strategy in cases of doubt, decipher unusual “if/then” statements, and so on. Sometimes there is no argument at all; other times there may exist more than one argument, such that there is a main argument, and a secondary argument. The point of this entire exercise is to learn the skill that so many of us fail to properly master: to learn what the opposing person is trying to say. What is their position? What is their argument if there is one? Only after we’ve successfully identified the argument can we then properly raise objections and evaluate their argument.
