While the first topic examines some fundamental concepts regarding the essence of wisdom, the majority of this unit is dedicated to unveiling practical skills essential for leading a wise and fulfilling life. We explore how to cultivate and apply these skills, emphasizing a proactive approach to embodying the principles of wisdom in our daily experiences. Wisdom Unit 1 Introduction Video (6 min 10 sec) Overview Topics This unit is divided into the following four topics: Wisdom and Knowledge Wisdom and Humility Wisdom and Friendship Wisdom and Rhetoric Learning Outcomes When you’ve completed this unit, you will have learned how to: Identify and understand the role wisdom plays in knowledge, humiloity, friendship and rhetoric Practice and apply the skills of wisdom to knowledge, humility, friendship and rhetoric Apply these skills to the types of actions a wise person may take Enhance your skills of wisdom and reason to live life within the context of justice and faith Develop the skills to become a well-rounded person and citizen and live a wise and just life 1.1 Wisdom and Knowledge Follow and complete the steps below to accomplish your learning for this topic. Read Topic Notes Watch Topic Video Read Topic Reading Complete Topic Exercise Complete Topic Questionnaire Watch Optional Video Topic Notes In this topic, we delve into the essence of wisdom and its intricate relationship with knowledge. Wisdom transcends mere information; it is a practical virtue essential for navigating life’s complexities, confronting challenges, and ideally, circumventing adversity. While wisdom is rooted in practicality, it necessitates a foundation of knowledge. To lead a well-lived life, wisdom calls for an understanding of the right beliefs and the skill to apply them judiciously and timely. Philosopher Robert Nozick contends that a wise individual possesses beliefs spanning various facets of life, encompassing crucial values, strategies for goal achievement, and the requisite steps to realize these objectives. Furthermore, wise actions, integral to a fulfilling life, stem from the application of these foundational beliefs. Mere possession of knowledge does not equate to wisdom; the discerning application of beliefs in one’s behavior is paramount. Nozick acknowledges that, despite meticulous planning and application of appropriate beliefs and actions, unforeseen challenges may arise, disrupting our endeavors. A wise individual anticipates this inherent uncertainty, preparing for potential setbacks, acquiring the skills to avert failure, and developing resilience to respond effectively when faced with adversity. In essence, wisdom involves not only knowing what is right but also navigating the unpredictable nature of life with foresight, adaptability, and a resilient spirit.

Read Topic Notes Watch Topic Video Read Topic Reading Complete Topic Exercise Complete Topic Questionnaire Watch Optional Video Topic Notes Within this topic, our attention shifts to the intertwining realms of wisdom and humility. A wise individual possesses a keen awareness of the boundaries of their knowledge, acknowledging both what they comprehend and what lies beyond their understanding. Here, “ignorance” is not disparaging but denotes a specific lack of knowledge in a given domain. The dialogue unfolds in Plato’s “the Apology,” where Socrates, perplexed by the Oracle of Delphi’s proclamation that no one is wiser than he, embarks on a quest to unravel the meaning of this paradox. Through dialogues with politicians, poets, and artisans, Socrates discovers that those who claim profound knowledge often lack true understanding. The pivotal distinction lies in Socrates’ awareness of his ignorance, particularly regarding the nature of beauty and what is good, in contrast to others who falsely believe they possess knowledge. This self-awareness becomes the hallmark of Socrates’ wisdom. Applying the principle of acknowledging ignorance to the pursuit of wisdom involves cultivating a humble stance towards life’s intricate questions. Whether grappling with the interpretation of the Bible, contemplating evolutionary theories, exploring the nature of sexuality, evaluating the impact of social media, or assessing the effectiveness of political leadership, a wise person approaches these complex issues with humility. This involves posing thoughtful questions, recognizing the limits of one’s own understanding, refraining from hasty judgments, and maintaining a receptivity to evolving perspectives. In essence, humility becomes a guiding virtue in the pursuit of wisdom, fostering a mindset that values curiosity, open-mindedness, and the continual quest for understanding.

Read Topic Notes Watch Topic Video Read Topic Reading Complete Topic Exercise Complete Topic Questionnaire Watch Optional Video Topic Notes The third topic explores the intricate relationship between wisdom and friendship, emphasizing the discerning approach a wise individual takes in understanding the various dimensions of companionship. To navigate this terrain effectively, it is imperative to comprehend the diverse types of friendships, as expounded by Aristotle. Aristotle categorizes friendships into three distinct types: those based on utility, pleasure, and virtue. Friends of utility serve as instrumental connections, such as business partners or teammates in sports. Friends of pleasure share enjoyable activities, while friends of virtue embody individuals with admirable qualities, actively contributing to our moral development. Aristotle contends that friendships rooted in virtue are the most profound, albeit challenging to cultivate. Such friendships extend beyond mere utility or pleasure; they transcend difficulties, demonstrating a genuine concern for one another’s character development. Thomas Aquinas further enriches this discourse by cautioning against qualities that undermine the pursuit of virtue in friendships. Envy, manifesting as displeasure at a friend’s success, and arrogant pride, reflected in an inability to handle jests or an inflated sense of self-worth, are identified as detrimental vices. Aquinas urges us to be vigilant in recognizing and avoiding these pitfalls, both in our friends and within ourselves. Crucially, this exploration prompts introspection. Are our friendships solely utilitarian or pleasure-seeking? Do we harbor envy towards our friends’ accomplishments? Do we exhibit arrogant pride? The video introduces these insights from Aristotle and Aquinas, providing valuable guidance to nurture robust and virtuous friendships conducive to a life well-lived.

A wise individual possesses the skill to navigate these discussions without descending into conflict. According to Jay Heinrichs, productive argumentation requires a clear understanding of the desired outcome. The crucial skill in constructive argumentation involves defining the appropriate goal for the situation. Are you seeking to influence a decision, aiming for a sense of victory, or hoping to shift your opponent’s mood or perspective? Perhaps your goal is to efficiently conclude the argument while maintaining a positive relationship with the other person. Each goal requires a tailored approach, prompting consideration of the feasibility of your objectives and the methods to achieve them. Moreover, one ought to consider reflecting on the post-argument scenario. Do you wish to uphold the relationship after the disagreement? What compromises are you willing to make, and are you prepared to acknowledge defeat from your opponent’s perspective if it serves your overarching goal? Heinrichs encourages a thoughtful examination of the argument’s purpose, emphasizing the strategic choices and compromises necessary to align with your desired outcome. In essence, this exploration aims to equip individuals with the skills and insights to engage in persuasive and constructive discussions, fostering an environment where arguments serve as tools for understanding and collaboration rather than sources of conflict.

Our exploration will center around the intricate nature of faith, encompassing not only the attitudes associated with faith, such as beliefs and trust, but also delving into the actions inspired by faith, with a brief emphasis on ethical considerations. Lastly, our journey will lead us to scrutinize the rationality of faith, contemplating its alignment with evidence and the broader spectrum of reasoned thought.

Read Topic Notes Watch Topic Video Read Topic Reading Complete Note-Taking Exercise Complete Topic Questionnaire Watch Optional Video Topic Notes The first topic includes considering the multifaceted definitions of the term “faith.” A pivotal distinction surfaces when considering faith both as an attitude and as an action. Faith as an attitude encapsulates the cognitive realm, residing in our thoughts and beliefs, encompassing notions of trust and hope. This conceptualization aligns with common perceptions of faith as a mental and cognitive experience. In contrast, faith as an action introduces an ethical dimension to the term. Rooted in the Greek word “pistis,” faith, in this context, pertains to ethical behavior directed towards a person or an ideal. This perspective invites us to view faith not merely as a mental state but as a manifestation of ethical considerations in our actions and conduct. Further nuances emerge within faith as an attitude, where we explore the differentiation between doxastic faith and non-doxastic faith. The term “doxastic” centers on belief, indicating a cognitive dimension to faith. Conversely, “non-doxastic” faith extends beyond mere belief, encompassing faith that operates independently of explicit cognitive assent. This exploration aims to unravel the intricate layers of faith, encouraging a comprehensive understanding that spans both the cognitive and ethical dimensions of this complex and significant concept. Topic Video In this video, you will learn about the various definitions of faith from Elizabeth Jackson’s article, “Faith: Contemporary Perspectives”.

Read Topic Notes Watch Topic Video Read Topic Reading Complete Topic Exercise Complete Topic Questionnaire Watch Optional Video Topic Notes Building on our exploration of faith as an attitude, particularly focusing on belief and trust in the previous topic, we now inquire into a non-doxastic facet of faith: hope. Unlike belief and trust, hope doesn’t necessarily hinge on cognitive assent, marking it as a non-doxastic attitude within the realm of faith. Louis Pojman contends that understanding faith as hope is particularly relevant, especially in the context of Christian faith and the doctrine of salvation. The concept of salvation suggests that humanity is in jeopardy, and God is endeavoring to rescue them. Traditional perspectives posit that belief in God is a prerequisite for salvation. However, Pojman challenges this notion, recognizing that humans don’t have absolute control over their beliefs, including doubts about God. In this context, the idea that salvation is contingent on something beyond one’s control raises questions. Pojman argues that faith as hope in God and his redemptive plan provides a more accurate and inclusive perspective on faith and salvation. By emphasizing hope as a non-doxastic attitude within faith, this discussion broadens our understanding of faith beyond mere cognitive elements, offering a nuanced perspective that aligns with the complexities of belief, doubt, and the pursuit of salvation. Watch and Reflect In this video, you will learn about faith as hope in the midst of doubt from Louis Pojman’s article, “Faith, Hope, Doubt”.

Read Topic Notes Watch Topic Video Read Topic Reading Complete Topic Exercise Complete Topic Questionnaire Watch Optional Video Topic Notes In our recent discussions, we’ve examined faith as an attitude, encompassing beliefs, trust, and hope—mental and cognitive experiences that reside within an individual. Shifting the focus, we now explore faith as action, centering on behavioral aspects rather than solely on mental experiences. While beliefs, desires, and hopes may influence actions, this connection is not absolute. Consequently, faith as action directs attention to ethical behavior as the primary mode of expressing faith. In this third topic, we briefly navigate a theological controversy within Christianity concerning the definition of faith. Traditionally, faith was construed as an attitudinal concept, emphasizing beliefs and trust. However, contemporary perspectives challenge this tradition, proposing that Christian faith is more intricately linked to Christian ethics and good works, de-emphasizing the importance of specific attitudinal beliefs and trust in Christianity. This exploration invites us to reconsider the nature of faith within the Christian context, prompting reflection on whether faith should be predominantly characterized by mental attitudes or by the ethical conduct and good works that spring forth from one’s beliefs. Watch and Reflect In this video, you will learn about faith and action from Boyd and Thorsen’s chapter, “Ethics in the Christian Scriptures.” Unlike faith as belief, trust, and hope, faith as action focuses on behavior and ethics, rather than on mental content.

Read Topic Notes Watch Topic Video Read Topic Reading Complete Topic Exercise Complete Topic Questionnaire Watch Optional Video Topic Notes In our preceding discussions, we touched upon various definitions of faith, distinguishing between faith as attitudes and faith as actions. While these categories may overlap, they can also maintain distinct identities. However, a persistent challenge to these notions of faith arises from critics who question the rationality of faith, whether conceived as belief and trust or as action. This final topic examines this challenge. The term “rationality” here pertains to the alignment of beliefs and actions with evidence. According to the evidentialist perspective, if beliefs and actions deviate from the evidence, they are deemed irrational. Hence, the objection posits that to exhibit rationality, one must align beliefs and actions according to the available evidence. The ensuing exploration assesses the strength of this objection, beginning with an examination of William Clifford’s renowned work on the ethics of belief. Clifford contends that it is ethically wrong to believe anything not proportional to the evidence. To evaluate this evidential objection, we consider several responses, including the potential incoherence of the objection, the observation that many of our rational beliefs are not strictly proportional to the evidence, and the recognition that, in certain cases of faith, there may be sufficient evidence to meet rational standards. Watch and Reflect In this video, you will learn about faith and rationality from W.K. Clifford’s article, “The Ethics of Belief.” You will be introduced to the evidential objection to religious belief, which states that religious belief is rational only if there is evidence for religious belief, and some brief responses and replies to this evidential objection.

This unit is valuable because everything we’ve discussed so far, both about wisdom and faith, is built upon the foundation of arguments. We give arguments for our views about wisdom. We give arguments about issues of faith and rationality. This last unit provides the opportunity for you to learn a basic skill of how to identify an argument, whether the argument is located in a book, and more often on YouTube, a podcast, and in the news. Note that we do not cover how to evaluate arguments in this unit. Evaluating arguments is a skill taught in other philosophy courses. In topic 1, we learn about the parts of the argument, such as the proper terms used to designate these different parts. If we wish to learn how to identify arguments, we must know what terms to look for. In topic 2, we learn about how to label and structure arguments. Often people do not organize their argument clearly and so we must learn how to reconstruct the argument so that we know the conclusion and the reasons for supporting the conclusion. In topic 3, we tackle slightly more complicated arguments and learn how to interpret what the author intended to say. As practiced in topic 2, people often organize their arguments (or, occasionally, non-arguments) in a confusing way. Moreover, we will learn about tricky terms often used in arguments, such as the terms “if” and “then”. In the final topic, we practice identifying difficult arguments, which often include long texts, run on sentences, and additional irrelevant content to the argument being put forward. Our task in the final topic is to use our skills practiced in topics 1-3 to identify more difficult arguments.

Read Topic Notes Watch Topic Video Complete Logic Exercise 1 Complete Logic Exercise 2 Watch Optional Video Topic Notes In this topic, we learn about the parts of the argument and the words often used to designate these parts. Arguments are made up of statements. Statements are claims that are either true or false. Sometimes statements are whole sentences, while other times statements are phrases. For example, the question, “Is there a God?” is not a statement because the question does not state something that is either true or false. The answer to this question, “yes there is a God,” or “no, there is no God” are statements because they express claims that are either true or false. Other parts of the argument are the premises and conclusion. The premises are the statements that support the conclusion. The conclusion is the statement that is being argued for by the premises. The inference is the move from the premises to the conclusion. Imagine someone says they believe that God exists. This is their conclusion. You ask them, “why think that God exists?” Their response is going to be a reason (i.e. a premise) or a set of reasons (i.e. a set of premises) that are supposed to support their conclusion. The inference is the nature of the support from premise to conclusion. Some of the primary keywords of an argument are terms that describe premises and conclusions. For example, the word “therefore” often picks out a conclusion. The statement that follows from the term “therefore” may act as a conclusion. Terms that describe premise can be “all” “every” “some”. As we shall see, these types of words help us identify the premises of an argument.

In this topic, we learn how to label these parts of the argument and then restructure the argument vertically, with premises and conclusion, so that we may see the argument clearly. The steps for applying these tools follow this pattern: (i) focus on statements and ignore non-statements. Recall from the previous topic that arguments are made up of statements only and never non-statements. Thus, only focus on statements and cross out any non-statements. (ii) Locate the premises and conclusion amongst the set of statements using keywords. As discussed, premises and conclusions often have terms that designate them, such as “therefore”. Once the argument has been labelled, the next step is to restructure the argument vertically with the premises on top and the conclusion beneath. This way we can see what the author’s argument is exactly. That is, we can see the conclusion – the main point of their position – and the reasons (i.e. premises) for thinking the conclusion is true. Once these statements are ordered correctly, anyone can see the argument. The reader needn’t labour over the text and the many confusing non-statements to locate the point of the passage.

Read Topic Notes Watch Topic Video Complete Logic Exercise 1 Complete Logic Exercise 2 Watch Optional Video Topic Notes In the first two topics, we learned some foundational skills for identifying arguments, such as the parts and keywords of an argument, and the methods for labeling and restructuring arguments. The challenge, however, is that ordinary discourse – both written and verbal – often makes the argument difficult to identify. We often must interpret what we think the author intended to say about their view and then structure the argument according to this intention. In this topic, we practice the skill of interpretating arguments. One strategy for interpreting an argument is the “Why/Because” strategy. If it’s difficult to identify the premises and conclusion, then look for statements that may follow with a hypothetical “why”. Such statements may be the conclusion(s). The reason is that concluding statements have by definition reasons for them. And the term “why” may pick out these reasons. The term “because” often precedes a reason (i.e. a premise) and so looking for statements that may be preceded with “because” may help with identifying the premises. A second skill of interpretation is learning to navigate conditional statements. A conditional is a “if … then” statement. For example, “If it’s raining outside, then we can’t go to the park.” Sentences with the words “if” and “then” may be interpreted in different ways depending on the order of these words. In this topic we practice some of these interpretive skills.

Read Topic Notes Watch Topic Video Complete Logic Exercise Complete Practice Exercises Watch Optional Video Topic Notes In the previous topics, we have attempted to build our foundation for identifying arguments. The real challenge is when we’re confronted with long speeches, texts, reports, stories, and accusations whereby the argument may often seem unclear. Our task is to use the tools we’ve learned to identify the argument(s) in more difficult contexts. In this topic, we practice these skills by following these steps: (i) ignore non-statements and label the premises and conclusion; (ii) restructure the argument vertically with premises on top and the conclusion beneath. Notice that the difficult step is (i). We must sift through the content to locate keywords, interpret ambiguous statements, possibly use the “Why/Because” strategy in cases of doubt, decipher unusual “if/then” statements, and so on. Sometimes there is no argument at all; other times there may exist more than one argument, such that there is a main argument, and a secondary argument. The point of this entire exercise is to learn the skill that so many of us fail to properly master: to learn what the opposing person is trying to say. What is their position? What is their argument if there is one? Only after we’ve successfully identified the argument can we then properly raise objections and evaluate their argument.
