While we will learn some basic ideas about the nature of wisdom in the first topic on knowledge, most of this unit is devoted to introducing some of the skills of living a life of wisdom and how we can begin to practice these skills. Wisdom Unit 1 Introduction Video (6 min 10 sec) Overview Topics This unit is divided into the following topics: Wisdom and Knowledge Wisdom and Humility Wisdom and Friendship Wisdom and Rhetoric Learning Outcomes When you’ve completed this unit, you will have learned how to: Identify and understand the role wisdom plays in knowledge, humiloity, friendship and rhetoric Practice and apply the skills of wisdom to knowledge, humility, friendship and rhetoric Apply these skills to the types of actions a wise person may take Enhance your skills of wisdom and reason to live life within the context of justice and faith Develop the skills to become a well-rounded person and citizen and live a wise and just life 1.1 Wisdom and Knowledge In this topic, we learn about the nature of wisdom and its relationship with knowledge. Wisdom is not just about knowledge. Wisdom is practical in that wisdom is required to live life well, to cope with and respond to the many challenges of life, and, if possible, avoid some of those challenges. While wisdom is practical, it does require at least some knowledge. For living life well, wisdom requires knowing the right beliefs and knowing how to apply these beliefs in the right way at the right time. How do we know which beliefs and actions are appropriate for living life well? Philosopher Robert Nozick argues that a wise person holds beliefs about many aspects of life, including beliefs about life’s most important values, beliefs about achieving one’s goals, and following the necessary steps to achieve these goals. Likewise, the right actions for living a fulfilling life are derived from applying the aforementioned beliefs. If a person knows about the most important values and goals in life, but never applies them to their behavior, then they are not considered wise. In other words, having knowledge does not entail wisdom. Nozick is also aware that applying the appropriate beliefs and actions is not sufficient to live life well. Sometimes bad things occur for no apparent reason, which may undermine our efforts. A wise person is aware of this problem, and while pursuing their goals, prepares for failure, learns how to avoid it, and how to respond to it if failure occurs. Watch and Reflect In this video, you will learn about wisdom and knowledge from Robert Nozick’s piece, “What is Wisdom and Why do Philosophers Love it So?” Wisdom and Knowledge Unit 1 Topic 1 (11 min 15 sec) Read and Reflect Robert Nozick - What is Wisdom and Why Do Philosophers Love It So? 1.2 Wisdom and Humility In this topic, we focus on wisdom and humility. A wise person understands their limitations about what they know and do not know. In other words, a wise person is aware of their ignorance. The word “ignorance” in this case does not have a negative connotation, but rather describes a lack of knowledge about a particular thing. In “the Apology,” Plato introduces the character Socrates, who is on trial for his life. During his defense, Socrates describes the account of his friend, Chaerephon, seeking answers from the Oracle of Delphi, wondering if there is any person wiser than Socrates. In reply to Chaerephon, the oracle says that no one is wiser than Socrates. Socrates is puzzled by the revelation about his wisdom since he considers himself to be unwise. Socrates then asks questions of different people in the city, such as politicians, poets, and artisans, in an attempt to solve the mystery about the oracle’s revelation. Socrates discovers that while these individuals claim to know a great deal about issues such as the nature of beauty and what is good, he observes that they know very little about such issues. These people think they possess knowledge, when in fact they do not, and that is why they lack wisdom. Their way of thinking contrasts with Socrates, who thinks he lacks knowledge about these issues; more specifically, Socrates is aware of his ignorance about the nature of beauty and what is good, while the others are unaware of their own ignorance about these same issues. Because of this, Socrates is the wisest person. One application of being aware of ignorance for seeking wisdom is to practice a humble attitude towards the complex issues in life, such as how to interpret the Bible, evolution, the nature of sexuality, the implications of social media for our lives, and was Donald Trump an effective president? These types of questions represent complex ideas that even some of the most specialized scholars cannot answer. A wise person demonstrates their humility towards these complex issues by asking thoughtful questions about the opposing view, knowing when to withhold judgment and opinion, and with a willingness to change their mind.

Watch: What is intellectual humility? 1.3 Wisdom and Friendship This topic examines wisdom and friendship. A wise person is careful about how they view their friends. In doing so, it is best to learn about the various types of friendships. According to Aristotle, there are three types of friendships, friends of utility, pleasure, and virtue. Friends of utility are friends who are a means to an end, such as business partners, or some friends on a sports team. Friends of pleasure are friends with whom we share pleasurable activities. Friends of virtue are friends who exhibit good qualities and help us develop these qualities as well. Aristotle believes that the third type of friend is the best type of friend, and this type of friendship, while difficult to find and develop, is worth pursuing and fighting for. This is because friends of virtue care about us and our character development beyond the scope of utility and pleasure. They care about us even when things are difficult. But how do we find these friends and how can we be virtuous friends to other people? Thomas Aquinas provides some advice. Aquinas suggests that we should be careful about the bad qualities that make for a poor friend, such as envy and pride. These vices (or bad characteristics) undermine the pursuit of virtue and thus compromise any friendship that is built upon virtue. An envious person is someone who is upset about our own success. Think of a friend you have. Have they ever been upset or sad when good things happen to you? If the answer is yes, then this person may not be a virtuous friend. They may suffer from envy towards you. Or have you ever had a friend who jokes about you but can never receive the joke in return? This person may not be a virtuous friend because they suffer from arrogant pride. They think too highly of themselves. Furthermore, we should be cautious about whether we are exhibiting these defects as well. Do we treat our friends as a means to a utilitarian end? Do we make friends only for pleasure? Do we feel upset about our friends success? Do we exhibit a sense of arrogant pride about ourselves? This video introduces these ideas from Aristotle and Aquinas to help better equip us with the skills for developing healthy friendship for living well. Watch and Reflect In this video, you will learn about wisdom and friendship from Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics, Books 8, 9 and 10, and some additional points from Thomas Aquinas.

Arguments with other people, such as family, friends, or colleagues, are part of everyday life. A wise person knows how to argue without fighting. According to Jay Heinrichs, a necessary skill for arguing productively is knowing the appropriate goal you wish to bring about. Are you trying to influence someone’s decision? Is that feasible? Are you hoping to feel like a winner? Is that an appropriate goal? It may be your goal to change the mood of your opponent, or simply to inform your opponent of a different point of view. Would you like to end the argument quickly? After the argument, would you like to maintain the relationship with the person? Should you pursue either of these goals? How will you go about accomplishing your goal? In what way are you prepared to compromise? Are you prepared to experience defeat from your opponent’s point of view in order to achieve your goal? What is the purpose of the argument and how should it be achieved?

"],["faith.html", "Unit 2 Faith Overview 2.1 Wisdom and Humility Lecture 1 2.2 Wisdom and Humility Lecture 2 2.3 Wisdom and Charity Required Note Taking Learning Activity", " Unit 2 Faith Overview This unit is divided into three lectures. Wisdom and Humility Lecture 1 discusses an allegory. Wisdom and Humility Lecture 2 is a section from Plato. Wisdom and Charity Lecture discusses the importance of first defending your opponent’s view before raising objections. Learning Outcomes When you’ve completed this unit, you will have learned how to: Apply wisdom to practice intellectual humility with knowledge Interpret Plato’s “The Apology” from a wise person’s perspective Develop and apply wisdom to strategies for practicing charity towards your opponents 2.1 Wisdom and Humility Lecture 1 This topic examines the first part about wisdom and humility. If wisdom includes learning and practicing the right types of knowledge and avoiding the wrong types of knowledge, then one ought to practice humility. One must find a way to accept their limitations about what they know. Indeed, the more one learns, often the more they realize how much they do not know. Thus, knowledge often extends outwards, growing more and more as one learns the topic. A wise person practices the skill of not caring about how much they think they know. A wise person practices the skill of not caring when they are wrong. Indeed, they recognize their error as the opportunity to grow in their knowledge. In the following video, we explore the allegory of the Knowledge Rooms to help us imagine the challenges of obtaining knowledge and the importance of maintaining a humble disposition. Read Plato’s Apology - https://classics.mit.edu/Plato/apology.html Watch Wisdom and Humility - Unit 2 Lecture 2.1 video (13 min 12 sec) This video introduces wisdom and humility. Intellectual humility is valuable for keeping our so-called knowledge in check. A wise person is aware of their own ignorance. This idea is made clearer with the allegory of the knowledge rooms. The term allegory means a kind of story to represent a deeper point. 2.2 Wisdom and Humility Lecture 2 This topic examines the second part about wisdom and humility. Plato believed that a wise person understands the limitations of what they know and do not know. In other words, a wise person is aware of their ignorance. The word “ignorance” in this case does not have a negative connotation, but rather describes a lack of knowledge about a particular thing. In “the Apology of Socrates,” Plato introduces the character Socrates, who is on trial for his life. During his defense, Socrates describes the account of his friend, Chaerephon, seeking answers from the Oracle of Delphi, wondering if there is any person wiser than Socrates. In reply to Chaerephon, the oracle says that no one is wiser than Socrates. Socrates is puzzled by the revelation about his wisdom since he considers himself to be unwise. Socrates then asks questions of different people in the city, such as politicians, poets, and artisans, in an attempt to solve the mystery about the oracle’s revelation. Socrates discovers that while these individuals claim to know a great deal about issues such as the nature of beauty and what is good, he observes that they know very little about such issues. These people think they possess knowledge, when in fact they do not, and that is why they lack wisdom. Their way of thinking contrasts with Socrates, who thinks he lacks knowledge about these issues; more specifically, Socrates is aware of his ignorance about the nature of beauty and what is good, while the others are unaware of their own ignorance about these same issues. Because of this, Socrates is the wisest person. One application of being aware of ignorance for seeking wisdom is to practice a humble attitude towards the complex issues in life, such as how to interpret the Bible, evolution, the nature of sexuality, the implications of social media for our lives, and was Donald Trump an effective president? These types of questions represent complex ideas that even some of the most specialized scholars cannot answer. A wise person demonstrates their humility towards these complex issues by asking thoughtful questions about the opposing view, knowing when to withhold judgment and opinion, and with a willingness to change their mind. In the following video, we explore Plato’s description of Socrates when confronted by his accusers and how Socrates seems to exhibit humility. Watch Plato’s The Apology of Socrates - Unit 2 Lecture 2.2 video (12 min 57 sec) This video expands on wisdom and humility. This includes a short section of Plato’s “The Apology of Socrates,” and reinforces the idea that a wise person is aware of their own ignorance. I wise person knows about their own skills and competency, but is also aware of the many things they do not know, such as their ideas about politics, sexuality, religion, and science. 2.3 Wisdom and Charity This topic examines wisdom and charity. The term “charity” in this case refers to a principle of treating a person’s argument and/or opinion in its strongest form. Charity involves more than humility. It requires willpower. One must willfully, and temporarily, embrace the opponent’s view, assist with constructing that view in its best possible light, and then express the view better than the opponent. The act of embracing an opposing argument is challenging for many reasons, but one reason is that humans are not built to act with charity toward those with whom they disagree, especially when those convictions are strong. Put in a different way, humans struggle to, on the one hand, affirm a viewpoint in which they hold strong convictions, and then, on the other hand, compartmentalize that view away while attempting to charitably evaluate objections to that conviction. A wise person practices charity because of their humility. They recognize the value of charity because they recognize the limitations of their knowledge. That is, perhaps the opponent’s view is correct. Or perhaps the spirit of the opponent’s view is correct, even if the opponent cannot properly state this view. Charity requires that we help this opponent first to be sure their view is represented accurately before raising counterpoints. In the following video, we examine this idea of charity and some of the problems with practicing charity. Watch Wisdom and Charity - Unit 2 Lecture 2.3 video (13 min 36 sec) This video introduces wisdom and charity. The term charity in this case applies to intellectual charity, which means presenting your opponents view in its strongest light before raising objections. A wise person does not take advantage of their opponent, such as their inability to communicate well, or the mistakes they make. Rather, a charitable person helps their opponent build their best case and then raise objections afterwards.

A wise person is careful about how they view their friends. In doing so, it is best to learn about the various types of friendships. According to Aristotle, there are several types of friendships, such as friends of utility, pleasure, and virtue. Friends of utility are friends who are a means to an end, such as business partners, or some friends on a sports team. Friends of pleasure are friends with whom we share pleasurable activities. Friends of virtue are friends who exhibit good qualities and help us develop these qualities as well. Aristotle believes that the third type of friend is the best friend, and this type of friendship, while difficult to find and develop, is worth pursuing and fighting for. In the following video, we briefly outline Aristote’s view of friendship and then figure how a wise person should think about friendship in these ways. Watch Wisdom and Friendship - Unit 3 Lecture 3.1 video (14 min 14 sec) This video introduces Aristotle’s view of friendship. A wise person is aware of the different types of friendships and the importance of these types. This video helps us understand what makes a good friend and how we can be good friends to other people. 3.2 Wisdom and Friendship Lecture 2 This topic examines the second part about wisdom and friendship. For Aristotle, friends of virtue are the best of friends because they care about us and our character development beyond the scope of utility and pleasure. They care about us even when things are difficult. But how do we find these friends and how can we be virtuous friends to other people? Thomas Aquinas provides some advice. Aquinas suggests that we should be careful about the bad qualities that make for a poor friend, such as envy and pride. These vices (or bad characteristics) undermine the pursuit of virtue and thus compromise any friendship that is built upon virtue. An envious person is someone who is upset about our own success. Think of a friend you have. Have they ever been upset or sad when good things happen to you? If the answer is yes, then this person may not be a virtuous friend. They may suffer from envy towards you. Or have you ever had a friend who jokes about you but can never receive the joke back to them in turn? This person may not be a virtuous friend because they suffer from arrogant pride. They think too highly of themselves. Furthermore, we should be cautious about whether we are exhibiting these defects as well. Do we feel upset about our friends success? Do we exhibit a sense of arrogant pride about ourselves? These vices undermine virtuous friendships. In the following video, we briefly outline Aquinas’ views about envy and pride and note how these vices undermine our friendships. Watch Wisdom and Friendship - Unit 3 Lecture 3.2 video (10 min 19 sec) This video introduces Aquinas’ view of pride and envy. These vices are damaging to friendships because they undermine virtue. This video helps us understand how to identify bad friends and how we can be aware of when we are being a bad friend to others. 3.3 Wisdom and Rhetoric Lecture 1 This topic examines the first part about wisdom and rhetoric. Rhetoric refers to the art of persuasion or influence. Previously we discussed how wisdom requires an awareness and application of our actions, knowledge, humility, charity, and friendship making. The art of persuasion applies to all of these skills. Rhetoric can help us get along in life in these various domains, particularly when dealing with other people. But many people throughout history have neglected this art of rhetoric. Indeed, Plato thought rhetoric was for fools. It was the art of manipulation. Rhetoric was for the sophists and those who only wished to confuse the masses, aiming these people away from the truth. However, his student, Aristotle, rejected Plato’s view. For Aristotle, rhetoric was a tool that, while available for manipulation, was equally valuable for communicating the truth. Rhetoric was the only weapon suitable to combat such manipulation. Thus, it is better to hone the skills of rhetoric to combat the sophists. In the following video, we analyze Plato’s objections to rhetoric and Aristotle’s reasons for rejecting Plato’s views and embracing the art of rhetoric. Read Jay Heinrichs - Thank You for Arguing Watch Wisdom and Rhetoric - Unit 3 Lecture 3.3 video (8 min 01 sec) This video introduces wisdom and rhetoric. Rhetoric is the art of persuasion. This is a valuable skill to practice in life because we often engage in rhetoric with other people, family, friends, supervisors, strangers, and even enemies. This video introduces Aristotle’s defense of using rhetoric against Plato’s criticisms of the practice. 3.4 Wisdom and Rhetoric Lecture 2 This topic examines the second part about wisdom and rhetoric. Arguments with other people, such as family, friends, or colleagues, are part of everyday life. A wise person knows how to argue without fighting. According to Jay Heinrichs, a necessary skill for arguing productively is knowing the appropriate goal you wish to bring about. Are you trying to influence someone’s decision? Is that feasible? Are you hoping to feel like a winner? Is that an appropriate goal? It may be your goal to change the mood of your opponent, or simply to inform your opponent of a different point of view. Would you like to end the argument quickly? After the argument, would you like to maintain the relationship with the person? Should you pursue either of these goals? How will you go about accomplishing your goal? In what way are you prepared to compromise? Are you prepared to experience defeat from your opponent’s point of view in order to achieve your goal? What is the purpose of the argument and how should it be achieved? Exercising the previous skills of wisdom when arguing with other people is helpful for practicing rhetoric. Wise actions, for example, require setting reasonable goals and avoiding the pitfalls that may undermine these goals. Similarly, when applying rhetoric in an argument with someone else, focus on the goal you wish to bring about and be willing to concede as much as possible to get there. Furthermore, remember that wisdom requires knowledge and humility. When these skills are applied to rhetoric, demonstrate the ability to challenge your own views to show your intention to understand the opponent’s position. And in everything, act with charity. When arguing with others, assist them with their arguments, and, if possible, suggest ways in which their arguments can be strengthened. Demonstrate your comfort with the exchange by temporarily embracing their viewpoint. Charity of this kind encourages your opponent to act in a similar manner, and, in doing so, may reduce the defensiveness of each person. Depending on your rhetorical goal when arguing with another person, the tactics above may be useful. The following video explores some of these simple rhetorical strategies to help us better get along with other people. Watch Wisdom and Rhetoric - Unit 3 Lecture 3.4 video (11 min 13 sec) This video expands on the study of rhetoric by discussing some strategies for applying rhetoric. One strategy is to set goals of the encounter and focus on what you must do to achieve these goals. Perhaps you want the other person to understand your view, or perhaps you want to end the encounter with the person as quickly as possible without making things worse. Practicing rhetoric can help us in these ways.
