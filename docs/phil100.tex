\section*{1.1 Wisdom and Action}\label{wisdom-and-action}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{1.1 Wisdom and Action}

This topic examines wisdom and action. According to Nozick, wisdom is practical in that wisdom is required to live life well, to cope with and respond to the many challenges of life, and, if possible, avoid some of those challenges. For living life well, wisdom requires both affirming the right beliefs and practicing the right actions. \textbf{How do we know which beliefs and actions are appropriate for living life well?} Nozick argues that a wise person holds beliefs about many aspects of life, including beliefs about life's most important values, beliefs about achieving one's goals, and following the necessary steps to achieve these goals. Likewise, the right actions for living a fulfilling life are derived from applying the aforementioned beliefs. If a person knows about the most important values and goals in life, but never applies them to their behavior, then they are not considered wise. In other words, having knowledge does not entail wisdom. Nozick is also aware that applying the appropriate beliefs and actions is not sufficient to live life well. Sometimes bad things occur for no apparent reason, which may undermine our efforts. A wise person is aware of this problem, and while pursuing their goals, prepares for failure, learns how to avoid it, and how to respond to it if failure occurs.

\section*{1.2 Wisdom and Knowledge}\label{wisdom-and-knowledge}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{1.2 Wisdom and Knowledge}

In the previous topic, we established that knowledge is not sufficient for wisdom because wisdom requires action. That is, knowledge must be applied correctly in order to live life well. While Descartes endorses that view of the limitations of knowledge and the importance of application, he maintains that one should pursue knowledge in the highest domains, such as knowledge of God, science, and morality, because that knowledge benefits the one pursuing wisdom and a fulfilling life.

There are two ideas associated with wisdom and knowledge to discuss. The first idea is that acquiring knowledge requires the practice of doubting. Do not believe everything you read and hear. The second idea is that a wise person obtains knowledge of the most valuable things in life, such as knowledge about God, science, and morality. According to Descartes, pursuing knowledge of these higher domains is not only a good in itself, but that higher knowledge can enable one to live a better life.

Having doubt about something does not entail rejecting its truth. For our purposes, doubting something means applying careful consideration, such as asking yourself: Why should I think this is true? What is the best way to verify the claim? Who can give me an informed opinion? Are there any concerns about this content? Which aspects of the content are strong and which are weak? Healthy doubt is valuable for acquiring knowledge and living life well. For example, whenever we detect incoming scams, such as phone and computer scams, we employ doubt. In this regard, one intends to uncover the nature of the scam and warn others of its harmful potential. The hesitation (or doubt) to believe and act according to the computer scam is similar to the hesitation one should apply when listening to the news, a podcast, a sermon, or reading an opinion on Facebook or Twitter. However, particularly in ordinary affairs, Decartes also warns that extreme doubt may be harmful. Neither the need for basic necessities nor the importance of friendship should be questioned. When individuals are faced with situations such as these, it is often necessary that they act even if they lack all the information about the situation. Descartes argues that remaining paralyzed by doubt is an inadvisable course.

To pursue a higher knowledge about God, science, and morality, Descartes imagines the structure of a tree, whose roots are metaphysics, the trunk is physics, and the branches represent the remainder of scientific inquiry, including morality (note that `science' in this context encompasses more domains than a contemporary definition of science). Descartes believed that in order to understand the human condition, one must have an understanding of metaphysics and science. Descartes' point about seeking this type of valuable knowledge about God, science, and morality is relevant because of the human obsession with entertainment. We often seek entertainment and pleasure rather than searching for the truth about the most important ideas in life. That obsession with entertainment and the neglect of seeking valuable knowledge undermines one's potential to gain wisdom and seek a fulfilling life.

\section*{2.1 Wisdom and Humility Lecture 1}\label{wisdom-and-humility-lecture-1}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{2.1 Wisdom and Humility Lecture 1}

This topic focuses on wisdom and humility. Our previous two topics discussed the importance of knowledge when seeking wisdom. Nevertheless, even Descartes recognizes that knowledge in some domains is difficult to obtain. Plato believed that a wise person understands their limitations about what they know and do not know. In other words, a wise person is aware of their ignorance. The word ``ignorance'' in this case does not have a negative connotation, but rather describes a lack of knowledge about a particular thing.

In ``the Apology,'' Plato introduces the character Socrates, who is on trial for his life. During his defense, Socrates describes the account of his friend, Chaerephon, seeking answers from the Oracle of Delphi, wondering if there is any person wiser than Socrates. In reply to Chaerephon, the oracle says that no one is wiser than Socrates. Socrates is puzzled by the revelation about his wisdom since he considers himself to be unwise. Socrates then asks questions of different people in the city, such as politicians, poets, and artisans, in an attempt to solve the mystery about the oracle's revelation. Socrates discovers that while these individuals claim to know a great deal about issues such as the nature of beauty and what is good, he observes that they know very little about such issues. These people think they possess knowledge, when in fact they do not, and that is why they lack wisdom. Their way of thinking contrasts with Socrates, who thinks he lacks knowledge about these issues; more specifically, Socrates is aware of his ignorance about the nature of beauty and what is good, while the others are unaware of their own ignorance about these same issues. Because of this, Socrates is the wisest person.

One application of being aware of ignorance for seeking wisdom is to practice a humble attitude towards the complex issues in life, such as how to interpret the Bible, evolution, the nature of sexuality, the implications of social media for our lives, and was Donald Trump an effective president? These types of questions represent complex ideas that even some of the most specialized scholars cannot answer. A wise person demonstrates their humility towards these complex issues by asking thoughtful questions about the opposing view, knowing when to withhold judgment and opinion, and with a willingness to change their mind.

\section*{2.3 Wisdom and Charity}\label{wisdom-and-charity}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{2.3 Wisdom and Charity}

In this topic, the emphasis is on wisdom and charity. The term ``charity'' in this case refers to a principle of treating a person's argument and/or opinion in its strongest form. In the previous two topics, we discussed humility and bias, both of which are relevant to practicing charity. For example, when employing humility, one is aware of their ignorance and the need to ask questions about the opponent's view. That questioning can be a type of charity when done for the purpose of gaining understanding. Similarly, one is aware of myside bias, and that bias influences the interpretation and treatment of the opponent, especially if that opponent is from another social group. Recognizing the powerful influence of myside bias promotes charity by helping constrain one's immediate rejection of the opponent's view.

Charity involves more than humility and awareness of bias: it requires willpower. One must willfully, and temporarily, embrace the opponent's view, assist with constructing that view in its best possible light, and then express the view better than the opponent. The act of embracing an opposing argument is challenging for many reasons, but, as stated in the previous chapter on bias, humans are not built to act with charity toward those with whom they disagree, especially when those convictions are strong. Put in a different way, humans struggle to, on the one hand, affirm a viewpoint in which they hold strong convictions, and then, on the other hand, compartmentalize that view away while attempting to charitably evaluate objections to that conviction.

In his article, ``Charity Begins at Home,'' Johnson outlines the general principle of charity and then discusses some of the challenges with that principle. Practicing charity involves three steps:

\begin{verbatim}
Identifying the argument: Does the argument even exist? According to Johnson, the first step is difficult in its own right because the art of constructing a well-organized argument is in decline.
Reconstructing the argument: This step requires that one re-build the argument to follow the rules of logical inference. Sometimes arguments include additional hidden premises, irrelevant information, and are simply weak or invalid. One must reconstruct the argument in its strongest form.
Presenting the main objections to the argument: Now that the argument has been identified and properly reconstructed, one should focus on the criticisms that undermine the main premises of the argument and avoid criticizing irrelevant information and implications of the argument.
\end{verbatim}

According to Johnson, a major problem with the principle of charity is that it requires too much effort and time to apply, as few people can construct an argument correctly in the first place. His solution to this problem is to apply the principle only when the following conditions are met: (i) the argument is fully expressed; (ii) the argument is brought forward by a serious person; (iii), the argument is about a serious issue. One implication of those criteria for the principle is that one should apply charity only when there is reason to think that the opponent will benefit from that charity.

\section*{3.3 Wisdom and Rhetoric Lecture 1}\label{wisdom-and-rhetoric-lecture-1}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{3.3 Wisdom and Rhetoric Lecture 1}

This topic is about wisdom and rhetoric. Rhetoric refers to the art of persuasion or influence. Previously we discussed how wisdom requires an awareness and application of our actions, knowledge, humility, biases, and charity. The art of persuasion employs all of these skills. Along with those skills of wisdom, rhetoric also requires some tools of argumentation. A clarification regarding rhetoric is that the terms ``argument'', ``argue'', and ``argumentation'' can mean different things in different contexts. Students will learn the technical definitions of ``argument'' and ``argumentation'' in Unit 2, which may differ from how those terms are used in this topic of rhetoric. The student will also have the opportunity to develop some of the tools of technical argumentation in Unit 2, which will hone their rhetorical skills.

Arguments with other people, such as family, friends, or colleagues, are part of everyday life. A wise person knows how to argue without fighting. According to Heinrichs, a necessary skill for arguing productively is knowing the appropriate goal you wish to bring about. Are you trying to influence someone's decision? Is that feasible? Are you hoping to feel like a winner? Is that an appropriate goal? It may be your goal to change the mood of your opponent, or simply to inform your opponent of a different point of view. Would you like to end the argument quickly? After the argument, would you like to maintain the relationship with the person? Should you pursue either of these goals? How will you go about accomplishing your goal? In what way are you prepared to compromise? Are you prepared to experience defeat from your opponent's point of view in order to achieve your goal? What is the purpose of the argument and how should it be achieved?

Exercising the previous skills of wisdom when arguing with other people is helpful for practicing rhetoric. Wise actions, for example, require setting reasonable goals and avoiding the pitfalls that may undermine these goals. Similarly, when applying rhetoric in an argument with someone else, focus on the goal you wish to bring about and be willing to concede as much as possible to get there. Furthermore, remember that wisdom requires knowledge and humility. When those skills are applied to rhetoric, demonstrate the ability to challenge your own views to show your intention to understand the opponent's position. Knowledge of one's own bias is also essential to rhetoric. Ensure that the opponent understands that you are aware of your own biases and that you will listen to and learn from them. And in everything, act with charity. When arguing with others, assist them with their arguments, and, if possible, suggest ways in which their arguments can be strengthened. Demonstrate your comfort with the exchange by temporarily embracing their viewpoint. Charity of this kind encourages your opponent to act in a similar manner, and, in doing so, may reduce the defensiveness of each person. Depending on your rhetorical goal when arguing with another person, the tactics above may be useful.
