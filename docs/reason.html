<p>The second unit focuses on reason. In this unit, the goal is to learn (i) what is an argument, and (ii), how does one identify an argument. The skill of identifying arguments applies to many areas of life and it’s important to practice this skill. When you listen to Joe Rogan, Jimmy Kimmel, people on TikTok, Facebook, Fox, and CNN, one should search for the argument and then restructure the argument in its strongest form. Only after that process is complete does one then focus on evaluating the truth of the argument. (We do not cover evaluating the truth of arguments in this unit. Consider enrolling in Phil 103, 105, or 210 to explore how to evaluate arguments).</p>
<p>This unit is divided into the following topics:
1. The Parts of an Argument<br />
2. The Keywords of an Argument<br />
3. Labeling an Argument<br />
4. Restructuring an Argument<br />
5. Interpreting an Argument<br />
6. Arguments with “If…Then”<br />
7. Identifying Difficult Arguments</p>

<h3>Learning Outcomes<a href="reason.html#learning-outcomes-1" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>When you have completed this unit, you should be able to:
- Cultivate skills of logical argumentation.<br />
- Develop skills for living a life of wisdom and justice.<br />
- Know how to identify arguments by locating the premises and conclusion.<br />
- Practice the skills of wisdom and reason, such as humility.</p>

<p>For this unit, there are no assigned readings.</p>
<p>An argument is a set of statements organized in a specific way, for example:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>All humans are mortal. (Premise)</p></li>
<li><p>Lucy is human. (Premise)</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore, Lucy is mortal. (Conclusion)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The statements above are organized as an argument because one of the statements, the conclusion, is supported by the other set of statements, the premises. By reading these premises and the conclusion carefully, one can see that the premises support the truth of the conclusion. <strong>For our purposes, the order of the premises does not matter</strong>. For example, the following argument is the same as the argument above:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Lucy is human.</p></li>
<li><p>All humans are mortal.</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore, Lucy is mortal.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The space between the premises and the conclusion is called the <strong>inference</strong>. The line illustrates when the premises end and where the conclusion follows. The term “inference” refers to the relationship between premises and conclusion, and that relationship changes depending on the type of argument in use. Put in a different way, the inference refers to how one moves from premise to conclusion. Sometimes that inference is one of certainty, in that the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion; other times that inference is one of probability, in that the truth of the premises raises the probable truth of the conclusion. <strong>(You are not required to know about the different types of inferences in this class)</strong>._</p>
<p>The <strong>premises</strong> are the “reasons” for why one should think the <strong>conclusion</strong> is true, and therefore the conclusion is being defended with those premises. The premises and conclusion will always be described with <strong>statements</strong>, and statements are claims that are <strong>either true or false</strong>. Non-statements, however, do not express claims that are either true or false, and thus non-statements are never premises or conclusions. Knowing the difference between statements and non-statements is important because that knowledge will help with identifying the parts of the argument. For example:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Apples are red.</p></li>
<li><p>Tony Stark is Iron Man.</p></li>
<li><p>Was that a magic trick?</p></li>
<li><p>Hey, partner!</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The first two examples are statements because they express claims that are either true or false. The third example is a question and does not express a claim that is either true or false. Therefore, the third example is a non-statement. (Of course, if one answered the question by saying, “that is a magic trick,” then that answer to the question is a statement that is either true or false). The fourth example is an exclamatory greeting and does not express a claim that is either true or false. Therefore, the fourth example is a non-statement. Remember, then, that arguments are made up of statements and never made up of non-statements.</p>

<div class="caution">
<p><strong>Note</strong> that a <strong>statement</strong> is different from a <strong>sentence</strong>. A sentence has a subject and a predicate. The subject is what or whom the sentence is about, and the predicate is a description of the subject and contains the verb. Sometimes a whole sentence is one statement, for example:</p>
“The cat is in the hat.”
<!-- content goes here -->
</div>
<p>That entire sentence is a statement because the sentence is either true or false. Other times a whole sentence includes multiple statements, for example:</p>
<p>“If the cat is in the hat, then the fish is in the bowl.”</p>
<p>In that example, the first part, “the cat is in the hat,” is the first statement, and the second part, “the fish is in the bowl,” is the second statement. So even though that example is one sentence, the entire sentence includes multiple statements that are either true or false.</p>
<p>More difficult sentences may include both statements and non-statements, for example:</p>
<p>“Stop, the train is approaching.”</p>
<p>In that example, the first part, “Stop,” is a non-statement, and the second part, “the train is approaching,” is a statement. The reason is because the word “Stop” does not express a claim that is either true or false, and the phrase “the train is approaching” does express a claim that is either true or false. <strong>When identifying the premises and conclusion of an argument, one should only focus on statements and always ignore non-statements.</strong></p>

[h5p id=“411”]</p>
<p>The purpose of Topic 1 was to introduce the elements of an argument, such as statements, non-statements, and sentences. We learned about the premises, conclusion, and inferences (note, again, that we do not cover inferences in this class). Topic 2 discusses the use of keywords to identify the premises and conclusion of an argument.</p>
<p>Some arguments are difficult to locate because the premises and conclusion remain unclear. In those difficult cases, one strategy for identifying the argument is locating <strong>keywords</strong> indicating the premises and conclusion. Keywords that indicate premises include: <strong>“All, every, most, some, none, for, because, If…then.”</strong> Keywords that indicate the conclusion are: <strong>“therefore, so, thus, hence, consequently, it follows that…”</strong> Consider the following example:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>All</strong> humans are mortal. (Premise)</li>
<li>Lucy is a human. (Premise)</li>
<li><strong>Therefore</strong>, Lucy is mortal. (Conclusion)</li>
</ol>
<p>In that example, the first premise follows the term “All,” and the conclusion follows the term “Therefore.” The second premise does not have a keyword, but, in this case, the reader knows that statement is not the conclusion – because the conclusion was identified already with the keyword “therefore” – and so the second statement must be a premise (this isn’t always the case, but we needn’t be concerned about that here). The argument is easy to identify because both the premise and conclusion have keywords.</p>

[h5p id=“413”]</p>
<p>In topics 1 and 2, we learned about the parts of an argument and some initial strategies for identifying arguments. The parts of an argument include statements, which are claims that are either true or false, such as premises and conclusions. We also learned that identifying an argument is simpler when there exist keywords for indicating those premises and conclusions. In Topic 3, we focus on how to label arguments by symbolizing premises and conclusions, for example:</p>
<p>“All humans are mortal, and Lucy is a human. So, Lucy is mortal.”</p>
<p>Unlike the examples of arguments in the topics 1 and 2, notice that this argument is not written vertically but horizontally. Most arguments written in ordinary discourse (e.g. the news, Facebook, etc.) will be expressed horizontally. That horizontal format already makes the argument more difficult to locate. The first sentence includes two statements and both statements are different premises of the argument. The conclusion is the second sentence indicated by the keyword “So.” The objective is to label the premises and conclusion with symbols so that the reader can identify the argument more accurately. In doing so, begin by first labeling the premises and conclusion by writing the letter “p” in parentheses at the beginning of the premises, and the letter “c” in parentheses next to the conclusion. For example:</p>
<p><strong>(P)</strong> All humans are mortal, and <strong>(P)</strong> Lucy is a human. <strong>(C)</strong> So, Lucy is mortal.</p>
<p>In that example, “P” stands for premise and (C) means conclusion. <strong>Note again: the order of the premises does not matter in this Unit. One can reverse the order of the premises and produce the same argument</strong>. When reading more complex arguments, labeling the premises and conclusion becomes essential to be sure one correctly identifies the argument.</p>

<p>//todo #15
[h5p id=“414”]</p>
<p>A major part of our learning in Topics 1-3 focused on the premises and conclusions of an argument. Additionally, we learned about the keywords for identifying those parts, and how to label the premises and conclusion with letters in parentheses. As illustrated in the previous topics, notice that writing an argument in vertical form, with premises on top and the conclusion on the bottom, is the most effective way to illustrate the final argument. For example,</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>All humans are mortal. (P)<br />
</li>
<li>Lucy is a human. (P)<br />
</li>
<li>Therefore, Lucy is mortal. (C)</li>
</ol>
<p>That vertical format is valuable for the reader to know exactly what the argument is about. Unfortunately, arguments in ordinary discourse are not written in that vertical fashion - as illustrated in Topic 3, where arguments were written horizontally - and therefore one must restructure the horizontal argument format to a vertical argument format. In Topic 4, we practice all of the methods above with the aim of restructuring the argument vertically.</p>

<h4>Practice Exercises<a href="reason.html#practice-exercises" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>[h5p id=“415”]</p>
<p>In Topics 1-4, we learned about the parts of the argument, how to locate keywords, label the parts of the argument with letters in parentheses, and how to restructure the argument vertically with premises at the top and conclusion at the bottom.</p>
<p>Another challenge with arguments written in ordinary discourse is not only that they’re written horizontally but they lack keywords for identifying premises and conclusions. When there are no keywords for identifying premise and conclusion, the reader must interpret what the author intended to say and then determine which statements are the premises and conclusion. Consider two examples, the first simpler and the second more complex. The first example is the following:</p>
<p>“I think Lucy is mortal. She is human and humans are mortal.”</p>
<p>This example does not include a keyword for the conclusion but rather uses the phrase “I think.” Furthermore, note that the conclusion comes first, “I think Lucy is mortal.” That informal way of writing the conclusion makes identification more challenging. Premise (1) also includes the pronoun “she”, which in this case refers to “Lucy.” Note also that premises (1) and (2) are statements within the same sentence, respectively, and lack keywords for identification. In most situations, arguments resemble this example in that they are unclear, and one must interpret the argument according to what the author intended to say. If we apply the steps from the previous examples, first label the premises and conclusion with letters:</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li>I think that Lucy is mortal. (P) She is human, and (P) humans are mortal.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that the argument is labeled, order the argument vertically with abbreviations in parentheses, and then <strong>observe</strong> the added keywords that provide a clear interpretation. For example:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Lucy</strong> is human. (P)<br />
</li>
<li><strong>All</strong> humans are mortal. (P)<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Therefore</strong>, Lucy is mortal. (C)</li>
</ol>
<p>Now the final version of that argument is clearer. We ordered the premises and conclusion vertically, replaced the pronoun “she” with “Lucy,” added the keyword “All” to premise (2), on the assumption that the author intended to refer to “all” humans and not “some” humans, and added the conclusion keyword “Therefore.”</p>
<p>The second more complex example is the following:
“Dogs must be man’s best friend.” Dogs are loyal and kind.”</p>
<p>In this example, there are no relevant keywords, and the conclusion may not be obvious. The task, then, is to carefully interpret the sentences and their relationship with each other to discover (1) does an argument even exist? and (2), if yes, then what are the premises and the conclusion?</p>
<p>Identifying the argument can be difficult. One technique for identifying obscure arguments like the one above is using the “Why/Because” strategy. A conclusion can always be followed by asking a hypothetical “Why?” and a premise can always be introduced with the term “Because.” Consider the following:</p>
<p>“Dogs must be man’s best friend. (<strong>Why</strong>)?…(<strong>Because</strong>) Dogs are loyal and (<strong>Because</strong>) dogs are kind.”</p>
<p>The first statement, “Dogs must be man’s best friend,” can be followed by asking “<strong>Why</strong> do you think that claim is true?” The second and third statements can be introduced with the term “because”. This process demonstrates that the first statement, followed by the term “why,” is the conclusion, and the second and third statements, preceded with the term “because,” are the premises. So, in difficult cases with a lack of keywords, locate the statements and note which statement best follows with a “Why?” (likely the conclusion), and the statements that best precede with a “Because” (likely the premises supporting that conclusion).</p>
<p>However, at times that strategy may create confusion because most statements could in principle be followed with a hypothetical “Why?” For example:</p>
<p>“Dogs must be man’s best friend. Dogs are loyal <strong>(Why?)</strong> and dogs are kind.”</p>
<p>In that example, the statement followed by the hypothetical “why?” is not the conclusion, but one could technically apply the strategy in that case, thereby creating confusion. How does one resolve this confusion? One strategy is to answer the “Why” question with the other statements involved, and test and compare each statement with another until the conclusion becomes more apparent. For example, suppose one wishes to test the statement, “Dogs are loyal,” to discover if that statement is the conclusion:</p>
<p>“Dogs are loyal.” <strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>Answer that question by using only the other two statements involved, for example:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Dogs are loyal. <strong>Why? Because</strong> dogs must be man’s best friend.<br />
</li>
<li>Dogs are loyal. <strong>Why? Because</strong> dogs are kind.</li>
</ol>
<p>Neither answer to the question seems accurate, because dog loyalty has to do with other characteristics absent from those statements. That process indicates that the statement, “dogs are loyal,” is likely not the conclusion. Repeat the process with the other two statements until a conclusion becomes evident. If there’s no apparent conclusion, then that may show the argument is poorly constructed.</p>
<p>A final comment is the terms “why” and “because” may be used in sentences without invoking an argument. For example,</p>
<p>“I’m at the birthday party because I was invited.”</p>
<p>Those statements do not (really) constitute an argument even though the term “because” is used and the term “why” is implied.</p>

<p>//todo #16
[h5p id=“425”]</p>
<p>In topics 1-5, we learned about the parts of the argument, and, in doing so, learned some strategies for identifying arguments. However, as arguments become more complicated, one must learn new techniques.</p>
<p>Some arguments use sentences with the terms “If…Then.” These types of sentences are called conditional sentences (or conditionals) and often appear in arguments. For example:</p>
<p>“<strong>IF</strong> Willy is a whale, <strong>THEN</strong> Willy is a mammal.”</p>
<p>As discussed briefly in an earlier section, note that some sentences may include multiple statements and thus include multiple premises. However, note that conditional sentences, while they may include multiple statements, <strong>always constitute one premise</strong>. That is, both “If…Then” statements in a conditional sentence are not different premises of the argument but are parts of the same premise.</p>
<p>For example:
1. <strong>If Willy is a whale, then Willy is a mammal.</strong> (P)<br />
2. Willy is a whale. (P2)<br />
3. Therefore, Willy is a mammal. (C1)</p>
<p><strong>The first premise includes both “If…Then” statements</strong>, and both statements in the conditional can be defined. The first statement following the term “If” is called the <strong>antecedent</strong>. That means the thing that comes before. The second statement following the term “Then” is called the <strong>consequent</strong>. That means the thing that comes after, or the thing that follows from the antecedent, for example:</p>
<p>“If Willy is a whale (antecedent), then Willy is a mammal (consequent).”</p>
<p>Conditional sentences are tricky business. While we needn’t be concerned with those difficulties in this Unit, three factors deserve attention for the purpose of identifying arguments: (i) notice that the terms “if’’ and “then” are keywords that may indicate a conditional premise; (ii), notice the conclusion in the argument above, “Willy is a mammal,” is smuggled into the second part (the consequent) of the first premise. When identifying a conditional sentence, the consequent of that conditional may be a clue for locating the conclusion (not always, but sometimes); and (iii), conditional sentences can be expressed in English in different ways. So one must learn to identify some of these expressions and practice how to convert them into standard “If…then” form.</p>
<p><strong>a. Sentences with the term “if” in the middle</strong></p>
<p>“Willy is a mammal <strong>IF</strong> Willy is a whale.”</p>
<p><strong>The term “if” introduces the antecedent, and the antecedent always comes first in the conditional sentence</strong>. So, rewrite the sentence above to standard conditional form by moving the term “if” and the antecedent, “Willy is a whale,” to the beginning of the sentence, and add the term “then” to the beginning of the consequent, “Willy is a mammal”:</p>
<p>“<strong>If</strong> Willy is a whale, <strong>then</strong> Willy is a mammal.”</p>
<p>Now the argument can be structured vertically, for example:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If Willy is a whale, then Willy is a mammal. (P)<br />
</li>
<li>Willy is a whale. (P)<br />
</li>
<li>Therefore, Willy is a mammal. (C)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>b. Sentences with the phrase “only if” at the beginning</strong>
“<strong>Only if</strong> Willy is a mammal, is Willy a whale.”</p>
<p><strong>The term “only if” introduces the consequent, and the consequent is always located at the end of the conditional sentence</strong>. So, change the term “only if” to “then” and move its consequent, “Willy is a mammal,” to the end. Then move the last statement, “Willy is a whale,” to the beginning with the term “If” added in front because that statement is the antecedent.</p>
<p>“If Willy is a whale, then Willy is a mammal.”</p>
<p><strong>c. Sentences with the phrase “only if” in the middle:</strong>
“Willy is a whale only if Willy is a mammal.”</p>
<p>Note, again, that the phrase “<strong>only if</strong>” introduces the consequent. Rewrite the sentence by converting “only if” to “then,” and add the term “If” to the beginning.</p>
<p>“If Willy is a whale, then Willy is a mammal.”</p>
<p><strong>d. Sentences with the term “unless” at the beginning</strong>
“<strong>Unless</strong> you eat vegetables, there’s no dessert.”</p>
<p><strong>The term “unless” introduces the antecedent with a negation</strong> (i.e. “not”) and is translated to “<strong>if not.</strong>” So, rewrite by replacing “unless” with “if not” and add the term “then” to the beginning of the consequent.</p>
<p>“<strong>If not</strong> you eat vegetables, <strong>then</strong> there’s no dessert.”</p>
<p>Obviously, that sentence above, although logically correct, must be rewritten to make sense:
“<strong>If</strong> you do <strong>not</strong> eat vegetables, then there’s no dessert.”</p>
<p><strong>e. Sentences with the term “unless” in the middle</strong>
“There’s no dessert UNLESS you eat vegetables.”</p>
<p>Rewrite by changing “unless” to “if not,” move “if not” and its statement, “you eat vegetables,” to the beginning to make the antecedent; add “then” to the second statement, “there’s no dessert,” to make the consequent.</p>
<p>“<strong>If</strong> you do not eat vegetables, <strong>then</strong> there’s no dessert.”</p>
<p><strong>f. Sentences with the phrase “provided that”</strong>
“You may eat dessert <strong>provided that</strong> you eat vegetables.”</p>
<p><strong>The phrase “provided that” introduces the antecedent</strong>. Rewrite by changing “provided that” to “if” and move “if” and its statement, “you eat vegetables,” to the beginning to make the antecedent; add the term “then” to the beginning of the other statement, “You may eat dessert,” to make the consequent, for example:</p>
<p>“<strong>If</strong> you eat vegetables, <strong>then</strong> you may eat dessert.”</p>
<p>Now you know how to identify different ways of expressing “If…then,” and how to rewrite those expressions to simplify ordering the argument vertically.</p>

[h5p id=“426”]</p>
<p>In the previous topics, we learned about identifying arguments. In this final topic, we apply those tools to identifying more difficult arguments. The examples below are more challenging because the arguments are not only greater length, but the arguments can be difficult to identify. One must carefully sift through the statements to decipher (i) does an argument exist, and (ii) if yes, then what is the conclusion(s) and the premises supporting that conclusion(s)? One must employ all the methods to achieve those tasks: such as ignoring non-statements, search for keywords that indicate premises and conclusions (highlight them, if that helps), label the premises and conclusions in parentheses, interpret what the author intended to say, and restructure the argument vertically in its strongest form. Note: more complex arguments often include multiple conclusions and those conclusions may operate as premises of the same argument. Note: when encountering a lengthy passage, read the entire passage through multiple times before attempting to identify the parts of the argument. The reason for that is to gain a broader understanding of what the author intended to say.</p>

<p>Example 3 is more challenging. In these types of cases, read through the entire passage several times to decipher the argument exactly. Take time to draft multiple arguments vertically and observe which version best represents what the author intended to say.</p>

<p>Unit 2 focused on how to identify arguments. Learning to identify arguments is valuable because sometimes we fail to both identify and understand an opponent’s argument before raising objections. Arguments are statements structured in a specific way, such that one the of the statements, the conclusion, is supported by the other statements, the premises. Statements are claims that are either true or false and can be expressed using sentences, subordinate clauses, and conditionals (to name a few), but never exclamatory sentences and questions. Students should know how to locate keywords for identifying premises and conclusion, know how to label both with letters in parentheses, and then order the premises and conclusion vertically. Students should have some knowledge about how to interpret and identify arguments in more complicated passages by using the “why/because” strategy.</p>
