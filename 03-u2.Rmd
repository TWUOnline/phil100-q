## 2.1 Wisdom and Humility Lecture 1 {-}

This topic examines the first part about wisdom and humility. If wisdom includes learning and practicing the right types of knowledge and avoiding the wrong types of knowledge, then one ought to practice humility. One must find a way to accept their limitations about what they know. Indeed, the more one learns, often the more they realize how much they do not know. Thus, knowledge often extends outwards, growing more and more as one learns the topic. A wise person practices the skill of not caring about how much they think they know. A wise person practices the skill of not caring when they are wrong. Indeed, they recognize their error as the opportunity to grow in their knowledge. In the following video, we explore the allegory of the Knowledge Rooms to help us imagine the challenges of obtaining knowledge and the importance of maintaining a humble disposition.

- This video introduces wisdom and humility. Intellectual humility is valuable for keeping our so-called knowledge in check. A wise person is aware of their own ignorance. This idea is made clearer with the allegory of the knowledge rooms. The term allegory means a kind of story to represent a deeper point.

## 2.2 Wisdom and Humility Lecture 2 {-}

This topic examines the second part about wisdom and humility. Plato believed that a wise person understands the limitations of what they know and do not know. In other words, a wise person is aware of their ignorance. The word “ignorance” in this case does not have a negative connotation, but rather describes a lack of knowledge about a particular thing.

In “the Apology of Socrates,” Plato introduces the character Socrates, who is on trial for his life. During his defense, Socrates describes the account of his friend, Chaerephon, seeking answers from the Oracle of Delphi, wondering if there is any person wiser than Socrates. In reply to Chaerephon, the oracle says that no one is wiser than Socrates. Socrates is puzzled by the revelation about his wisdom since he considers himself to be unwise. Socrates then asks questions of different people in the city, such as politicians, poets, and artisans, in an attempt to solve the mystery about the oracle's revelation. Socrates discovers that while these individuals claim to know a great deal about issues such as the nature of beauty and what is good, he observes that they know very little about such issues. These people think they possess knowledge, when in fact they do not, and that is why they lack wisdom. Their way of thinking contrasts with Socrates, who thinks he lacks knowledge about these issues; more specifically, Socrates is aware of his ignorance about the nature of beauty and what is good, while the others are unaware of their own ignorance about these same issues. Because of this, Socrates is the wisest person.

One application of being aware of ignorance for seeking wisdom is to practice a humble attitude towards the complex issues in life, such as how to interpret the Bible, evolution, the nature of sexuality, the implications of social media for our lives, and was Donald Trump an effective president? These types of questions represent complex ideas that even some of the most specialized scholars cannot answer. A wise person demonstrates their humility towards these complex issues by asking thoughtful questions about the opposing view, knowing when to withhold judgment and opinion, and with a willingness to change their mind. In the following video, we explore Plato’s description of Socrates when confronted by his accusers and how Socrates seems to exhibit humility.

- This video expands on wisdom and humility. This includes a short section of Plato’s “The Apology of Socrates,” and reinforces the idea that a wise person is aware of their own ignorance. I wise person knows about their own skills and competency, but is also aware of the many things they do not know, such as their ideas about politics, sexuality, religion, and science.

## 2.3 Wisdom and Charity {-}

This topic examines wisdom and charity. The term “charity” in this case refers to a principle of treating a person's argument and/or opinion in its strongest form. Charity involves more than humility. It requires willpower. One must willfully, and temporarily, embrace the opponent’s view, assist with constructing that view in its best possible light, and then express the view better than the opponent. The act of embracing an opposing argument is challenging for many reasons, but one reason is that humans are not built to act with charity toward those with whom they disagree, especially when those convictions are strong. Put in a different way, humans struggle to, on the one hand, affirm a viewpoint in which they hold strong convictions, and then, on the other hand, compartmentalize that view away while attempting to charitably evaluate objections to that conviction.

A wise person practices charity because of their humility. They recognize the value of charity because they recognize the limitations of their knowledge. That is, perhaps the opponent’s view is correct. Or perhaps the spirit of the opponent’s view is correct, even if the opponent cannot properly state this view. Charity requires that we help this opponent first to be sure their view is represented accurately before raising counterpoints. In the following video, we examine this idea of charity and some of the problems with practicing charity.

- Wisdom and Charity - Unit 2 Lecture 2.3 video (13 min 36 sec)
- This video introduces wisdom and charity. The term charity in this case applies to intellectual charity, which means presenting your opponents view in its strongest light before raising objections. A wise person does not take advantage of their opponent, such as their inability to communicate well, or the mistakes they make. Rather, a charitable person helps their opponent build their best case and then raise objections afterwards.
