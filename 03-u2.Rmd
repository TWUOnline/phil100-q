# Faith

This video briefly introduces the four topics in the second unit: definitions, hope, action, and rationality. We will learn about the nature of faith, both in terms of the attitudes of faith, such as beliefs and trust, and also the actions of faith, focusing briefly on ethics. Finally, we will learn about the rationality of faith and whether faith aligns with evidence.

## Overview {-}

### Topics {-}

This unit is divided into the following topics:

1. Faith and Definitions
2. Faith and Hope
3. Faith and Action
4. Faith and Rationality

### Learning Outcomes {-}

When you’ve completed this unit, you will have learned how to:

- Apply wisdom to practice intellectual humility with knowledge
- Interpret Plato’s “The Apology” from a wise person’s perspective
- Develop and apply wisdom to strategies for practicing charity towards your opponents

## 2.1 Faith and Definitions {-}

In this topic, we learn about several definitions of the term faith. One distinction to make about faith is between faith as an attitude and faith as an action. Faith as an attitude means that faith is something in our heads. Faith is a mental and cognitive experience, such as a belief, trust, and hope. These ideas are a common way to think about faith. On the other hand, faith as an action refers to an ancient way of thinking about the term. The Greek word for faith is “pistis” and this can refer ethical behavior towards a person or ideal. With regard to faith as an attitude, we will learn about the difference between doxastic faith and non-doxastic faith. The term “doxastic” refers to beliefs. Thus, doxastic faith is faith focusing on belief. Non-doxastic faith focuses on faith that does not include belief.

In this video, you will learn about the various definitions of faith from Elizabeth Jackson’s article, “Faith: Contemporary Perspectives”. The main focus is on learning about various distinctions with the concept of faith, such as attitude faith and action faith, and doxastic and non-doxastic view of faith.

## 2.2 Faith and Hope {-}

In the previous topic, we learned about various definitions of faith, mainly faith as an attitude. The first two ways of thinking about faith as an attitude are belief and trust. These attitudes of faith are called doxastic because they generally focus on beliefs – mental and cognitive experiences in our heads. In this topic, we focus on a non-doxastic attitude of faith called hope. Hope is non-doxastic because hope does not necessarily include belief when considering faith. Pojman is going to argue that faith as hope is the more appropriate way to think about faith, especially Christian faith and the doctrine of salvation. Salvation is the idea that the human race is in danger and God is attempting to save them. According to some traditions, if humans believe in God, then God will save them. But for Pojman, humans can’t control what they believe, including their doubts about God. So how can salvation be about something one cannot control? Rather, faith as hope in God and his saving plan seems to be the more accurate way to think about faith and salvation.

In this video, you will learn about faith as hope in the midst of doubt from Louis Pojman’s article, “Faith, Hope, Doubt”. According to Pojman, faith is a matter of hope and not belief. Thus, faith is non-doxastic.

## 2.3 Faith and Action {-}

In the previous two topics, we discussed faith as an attitude, such as a belief, a trust, or a hope. These conceptions of faith exist in one’s head – as a mental and cognitive experience. Faith as action focuses more on the behavior of a person and not as much on the mental experience. While it’s true that our beliefs and desires and hopes may be causally relevant for our actions, this needn’t always be the case. Thus, faith as action focuses more on ethical behavior as the mode of faith. In this topic, we briefly examine a controversy within Christian theology about the definition of faith. Traditionally, the view of faith was attitudinal, such as belief and trust. More recently, the suggestion is that Christian faith is about Christian ethics and good works and less so about having the attitudinal beliefs and trust about Christianity.

### Watch and Reflect {-}

In this video, you will learn about faith and action from Boyd and Thorsen’s chapter, “Ethics in the Christian Scriptures.” Unlike faith as belief, trust, and hope, faith as action focuses on behavior and ethics, rather than on mental content. You will also be introduced to the debate in Christian theology about faith and works.

## 1.4 Faith and Rationality {-}

In the previous topics, we briefly discussed some definitions of faith. A primary distinction is between faith as attitudes and faith as actions. While these categories may be interwoven, they can also remain distinct. Regardless, the critic of faith will challenge any of these ideas about faith by questioning the rationality of faith, either faith as belief and trust, or faith as action. In this topic, we explore this challenge. The term rationality in this case refers to beliefs and actions aligning with evidence. If beliefs and actions do not align with the evidence, then, according to the evidentialist, such beliefs and actions are irrational. So, according to the objection, for us to exhibit rationality, we must align our beliefs and actions according to the proper evidence. Is this a good objection to the rationality of faith as belief and action? We explore this issue by first reading William Clifford’s famous piece on the ethics of belief. According to Clifford, it is wrong to believe anything not proportional to the evidence. We then consider some response to this evidential objection by noting (i) the possible incoherence of the objection; (ii) the fact that may of our rational beliefs are not proportional to the evidence; (iii) that in some cases of faith, there exists sufficient evidence to meet the rational standard.

IIn this video, you will learn about faith and rationality from W.K. Clifford’s article, “The Ethics of Belief.” You will be introduced to the evidential objection to religious belief, which states that religious belief is rational only if there is evidence for religious belief, and some brief responses and replies to this evidential objection.
